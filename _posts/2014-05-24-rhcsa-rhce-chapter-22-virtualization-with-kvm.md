### KVM
From the [Virtualization Getting Started Guide](https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-us/red_hat_enterprise_linux/6/pdf/virtualization_getting_started_guide/red_hat_enterprise_linux-6-virtualization_getting_started_guide-en-us.pdf):

> What is KVM?
>
> KVM (Kernel-based Virtual Machine) is a full virtualization solution for Linux on AMD64 and Intel 64 hardware that is built into the standard Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6 kernel. It can run multiple, unmodified Windows and Linux guest operating systems. The KVM hypervisor in Red Hat Enterprise Linux is managed with the **libvirt** API and tools built for **libvirt** (such as **virt-manager** and **virsh**). Virtual machines are executed and run as multi-threaded Linux processes controlled by these tools.

and from the [Virtualization Tuning and Optimization Guide](https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-us/red_hat_enterprise_linux/6/pdf/virtualization_tuning_and_optimization_guide/red_hat_enterprise_linux-6-virtualization_tuning_and_optimization_guide-en-us.pdf) here is a quick overview:

### Installing The Hypervisor

From the [Virtualization Host Configuration and Guest Installation Guide](https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-us/red_hat_enterprise_linux/6/pdf/virtualization_host_configuration_and_guest_installation_guide/red_hat_enterprise_linux-6-virtualization_host_configuration_and_guest_installation_guide-en-us.pdf)

> ###Configuring a Virtualization Host installation
> This section covers installing virtualization tools and virtualization packages as part of a fresh Red Hat Enterprise Linux installation.
>
> #### Installing the virtualization package group
>
> 1. Launch the Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6 installation program <br>
>   Start an interactive Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6 installation from the Red Hat Enterprise Linux Installation CD-ROM, DVD or PXE.
>
> 2. Continue installation up to package selection <br>
>   Complete the other steps up to the package selection step.<br>
>   ![virt-host-select-rhel-install](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/elatov/upload/master/rhce_p22/virt-host-select-rhel-install.png)
>   Select the **Virtualization Host** server role to install a platform for guest virtual machines.
>
> #### Installing the virtualization packages with yum
>
> To use virtualization on Red Hat Enterprise Linux you require at least the **qemu-kvm** and **qemu-img** packages. These packages provide the user-level KVM emulator and disk image manager on the host Red Hat Enterprise Linux system.
>
> To install the **qemu-kvm** and **qemu-img** packages, run the following command:
>
>     # yum install qemu-kvm qemu-img
>
> Several additional virtualization management packages are also available:
>
> Recommended virtualization packages
>
> - **python-virtinst** - Provides the virt-install command for creating virtual machines.
> - **libvirt** - The libvirt package provides the server and host side libraries for interacting with hypervisors and host systems. The libvirt package provides the libvirtd daemon that handles the library calls, manages virtual machines and controls the hypervisor.
> - **libvirt-python** - The libvirt-python package contains a module that permits applications written in the Python programming language to use the interface supplied by the libvirt API.
> - **virt-manager** - virt-manager, also known as Virtual Machine Manager, provides a graphical tool for administering virtual machines. It uses libvirt-client library as the management API.
> - **libvirt-client** - The libvirt-client package provides the client-side APIs and libraries for accessing libvirt servers. The libvirt-client package includes the virsh command line tool to manage and control virtual machines and hypervisors from the command line or a special virtualization shell.
>
> Install all of these recommended virtualization packages with the following command:
>
> 	 # yum install virt-manager libvirt libvirt-python python-virtinst libvirt-client
>
> ####Installing Virtualization package groups
>
> The virtualization packages can also be installed from package groups. The following table describes the virtualization package groups and what they provide.
>
> Virtualization Package Groups
>
> ![virt-group-pkgs](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/elatov/upload/master/rhce_p22/virt-group-pkgs.png)
>
> To install a package group, run the `yum groupinstall <groupname>` command. For instance, to install the Virtualization Tools package group, run the **yum groupinstall "Virtualization Tools"** command.

Also from the Virtualization Host Configuration and Guest Installation Guide:

> ####Verifying virtualization extensions
>
> Use this section to determine whether your system has the hardware virtualization extensions. Virtualization extensions (Intel VT-x or AMD-V) are required for full virtualization.
>
>  1. Run the following command to verify the CPU virtualization extensions are available:
>
> 		$ grep -E 'svm|vmx' /proc/cpuinfo
>
>  2. Analyze the output.
>
>	The following output contains a vmx entry indicating an Intel processor with the Intel VT-x extension:
>
>		flags   : fpu tsc msr pae mce cx8 apic mtrr mca cmov pat pse36 clflush
> 		dts acpi mmx fxsr sse sse2 ss ht  tm syscall lm constant_tsc pni monitor ds_cpl
> 		vmx est tm2 cx16 xtpr lahf_lm
>
>	The following output contains an svm entry indicating an AMD processor with the AMD-V extensions:
>
> 		flags   :  fpu tsc msr pae mce cx8 apic mtrr mca cmov pat pse36 clflush
> 			mmx fxsr sse sse2 ht syscall nx mmxext fxsr_opt lm 3dnowext 3dnow pni cx16
> 		lahf_lm cmp_legacy svm cr8legacy ts fid vid ttp tm stc
>
>	If any output is received, the processor has the hardware virtualization extensions. However in some circumstances manufacturers disable the virtualization extensions in BIOS.
>
>	The "**flags**:" output content may appear multiple times, once for each hyperthread, core or CPU on the system.
>
> 	The virtualization extensions may be disabled in the BIOS.
>
>  3. Ensure KVM subsystem is loaded
>
> 	As an additional check, verify that the kvm modules are loaded in the kernel:
>
> 		# lsmod | grep kvm
>
> 	If the output includes **kvm_intel** or **kvm_amd** then the kvm hardware virtualization modules are loaded and your system meets requirements.

### Install KVM Hypervisor Example

So let's go ahead and install the necessary package to run KVM

	[root@rhel3 ~]# yum install qemu-kvm qemu-img

My VM was running on VMware and I followed the instructions laid out [here](http://www.virtuallyghetto.com/2012/08/how-to-enable-nested-esxi-other.html) to enable nested hypervisor support. Jarret had a [great blog](http://virtuallyhyper.com/2012/07/installing-kvm-as-a-virtual-machine-on-esxi5-with-bridged-networking/) on how to do it with ESXi 5.0. I was acutally on ESXi 5.5 and all that I had to do was add the following to the **vmx** of the VM:

	~ # tail -1 /vmfs/volumes/datastore1/RHEL_3/RHEL_3.vmx
	vhv.enable = "TRUE"

Then after installing the above packages I saw the **kvm** module loaded:

	[root@rhel3 ~]# lsmod | grep kvm
	kvm_intel              53484  0
	kvm                   316506  1 kvm_intel

and of course the CPU flags were there as well:

	[root@rhel3 ~]# grep -E 'svm|vmx' /proc/cpuinfo
	flags		: fpu vme de pse tsc msr pae mce cx8 apic sep mtrr pge mca cmov pat pse36 clflush dts mmx fxsr sse sse2 ss syscall nx rdtscp lm constant_tsc arch_perfmon pebs bts xtopology tsc_reliable nonstop_tsc aperfmperf unfair_spinlock pni pclmulqdq **vmx** ssse3 cx16 sse4_1 sse4_2 popcnt aes xsave avx hypervisor lahf_lm ida arat xsaveopt pln pts dts tpr_shadow vnmi ept vpid
	flags		: fpu vme de pse tsc msr pae mce cx8 apic sep mtrr pge mca cmov pat pse36 clflush dts mmx fxsr sse sse2 ss syscall nx rdtscp lm constant_tsc arch_perfmon pebs bts xtopology tsc_reliable nonstop_tsc aperfmperf unfair_spinlock pni pclmulqdq **vmx** ssse3 cx16 sse4_1 sse4_2 popcnt aes xsave avx hypervisor lahf_lm ida arat xsaveopt pln pts dts tpr_shadow vnmi ept vpid

### The libvirt daemon

From the [Virtualization Administration Guide](https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-us/red_hat_enterprise_linux/6/pdf/virtualization_administration_guide/virtualization-administration-guide.pdf)

> The **libvirt** daemon provides an interface for managing virtual machines. You must have the libvirtd daemon installed and running on every remote host that needs managing.
>
> 	$ ssh root@somehost
> 	# chkconfig libvirtd on
> 	# service libvirtd start
>
> After **libvirtd** and SSH are configured you should be able to remotely access and manage your virtual machines. You should also be able to access your guests with VNC at this point.

###  Libvirt and libvirt tools
From the Virtualization Getting Started Guide:

> The **libvirt** package is a hypervisor-independent virtualization API that is able to interact with the virtualization capabilities of a range of operating systems.
>
> The **libvirt** package provides:
>
> - A common, generic, and stable layer to securely manage virtual machines on a host.
> - A common interface for managing local systems and networked hosts.
> - All of the APIs required to provision, create, modify, monitor, control, migrate, and stop virtual machines, but only if the hypervisor supports these operations. Although multiple hosts may be accessed with libvirt simultaneously, the APIs are limited to single node operations.
>
> The **libvirt** package is designed as a building block for higher level management tools and applications, for example,**virt-manager** and the **virsh** command-line management tools. With the exception of migration capabilities, libvirt focuses on managing single hosts and provides APIs to enumerate, monitor and use the resources available on the managed node, including CPUs, memory, storage, networking and Non-Uniform Memory Access (NUMA) partitions. The management tools can be located on separate physical machines from the host using secure protocols.
>
> Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6 supports **libvirt** and included **libvirt**-based tools as its default method for virtualization management (as in Red Hat Enterprise Virtualization Management).
>
> The **libvirt** package is available as free software under the GNU Lesser General Public License. The libvirt project aims to provide a long term stable C API to virtualization management tools, running on top of varying hypervisor technologies. The libvirt package supports Xen on Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5, and it supports KVM on both Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5 and Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6.
>
> - **virsh** - The virsh command-line tool is built on the libvirt management API and operates as an alternative to the graphical virt-manager application. The virsh command can be used in read-only mode by unprivileged users or, with root access, full administration functionality. The virsh command is ideal for scripting virtualization administration.
> - **virt-manager** - virt-manager is a graphical desktop tool for managing virtual machines. It allows access to graphical guest consoles and can be used to perform virtualization administration, virtual machine creation, migration, and configuration tasks. The ability to view virtual machines, host statistics, device information and performance graphs is also provided. The local hypervisor and remote hypervisors can be managed through a single interface.
> - **virt-install** -  virt-install is a command line tool to provision new virtual machines. It supports both text-based and graphical installations, using serial console, SDL, SPICE, or VNC client/server pair graphics. Installation media can be local, or exist remotely on an NFS, HTTP, or FTP server. The tool can also be configured to run unattended and kickstart the guest when installation is complete, allowing for easy automation of installation. This tool is installed as part of the **python-virtinst** package.

#### Virsh

From the Virtualization Administration Guide:

> **virsh** is a command line interface tool for managing guest virtual machines and the hypervisor. The **virsh** command-line tool is built on the **libvirt** management API and operates as an alternative to the **qemu-kvm** command and the graphical **virt-manager** application. The **virsh** command can be used in read-only mode by unprivileged users or, with root access, full administration functionality. The **virsh** command is ideal for scripting virtualization administration.

#### Virsh Commands

From the same guide:

> The commands in this section are generic because they are not specific to any domain.
>
> **help**
>
> `$ virsh help [command|group]` The help command can be used with or without options. When used without options, all commands are listed, one perline. When used with an option, it is grouped into categories, displaying the keyword for each group.
>
> To display the commands that are only for a specific option, you need to give the keyword for that group as an option. For example:
>
> 	$ virsh help pool
> 	 Storage Pool (help keyword 'pool'):
> 		find-storage-pool-sources-as   find potential storage pool sources
> 		find-storage-pool-sources      discover potential storage pool sources
> 		pool-autostart                 autostart a pool
> 		pool-build                     build a pool
> 		pool-create-as                 create a pool from a set of args
> 		pool-create                    create a pool from an XML file
> 		pool-define-as                 define a pool from a set of args
> 		pool-define                    define (but don't start) a pool from an XML file
> 		pool-delete                    delete a pool
> 		pool-destroy                   destroy (stop) a pool
> 		pool-dumpxml                   pool information in XML
> 		pool-edit                      edit XML configuration for a storage pool
> 		pool-info                      storage pool information
> 		pool-list                      list pools
> 		pool-name                      convert a pool UUID to pool name
> 		pool-refresh                   refresh a pool
> 		pool-start                     start a (previously defined) inactive pool
> 		pool-undefine                  undefine an inactive pool
> 		pool-uuid                      convert a pool name to pool UUID
>
> Using the same command with a command option, gives the help information on that one specific command. For example:
>
> 	$virsh help vol-path
> 	  NAME
> 		vol-path - returns the volume path for a given volume name or key
>	
> 	  SYNOPSIS
> 		vol-path <vol> [--pool <string>]
>	
> 	  OPTIONS
> 		[--vol] <string>  volume name or key
> 		--pool <string>  pool name or uuid
>
> **quit and exit**
>
> The quit command and the exit command will close the terminal. For example:
>
> 	$virsh exit
> 	$virsh quit
>
> **version**
>
> The version command displays the current libvirt version and displays information about where the build is from. For example:
>
> 	$ virsh version
> 	Compiled against library: libvirt 1.1.1
> 	Using library: libvirt 1.1.1
> 	Using API: QEMU 1.1.1
> 	Running hypervisor: QEMU 1.5.3
>
> **connect**
>
> Connects to a hypervisor session. When the shell is first started this command runs automatically when the URI parameter is requested by the **-c** command. The URI specifies how to connect to the hypervisor. The most commonly used URIs are:
>
> - **xen:///**- connects to the local XEN hypervisor
> - **qemu:///system** - connects locally as root to the daemon supervising QEMU and KVM domains.
> - **xen:///session** - connects locally as a user to the user's set of QEMU and KVM domains
> - **lxc:///** - connects to a local Linux container
>
> The command can be run as follows:
>
> 	$virsh connect {name|URI}
>
> Where **{name}** is the machine name (hostname) or URL (the output of the **virsh uri** command) of the hypervisor. To initiate a read-only connection, append the above command with **--readonly**. For more information on URIs refer to Remote URIs If you are unsure of the URI, the uri command will display it:
>
> 	$ virsh uri
> 	qemu:///session

### Libvirt and virsh Example

So let's go ahead and install **libvirtd** and ensure that it's running:

	[root@rhel3 ~]# yum install libvirt
	[root@rhel3 ~]# chkconfig --list libvirtd
	libvirtd       	0:off	1:off	2:off	3:on	4:on	5:on	6:off
	[root@rhel3 ~]# service libvirtd status
	libvirtd is stopped
	[root@rhel3 ~]# service libvirtd start
	Starting libvirtd daemon:                                  [  OK  ]
	[root@rhel3 ~]# service libvirtd status
	libvirtd (pid  2006) is running...

Now let's install **virsh** and connect to **libvirtd**:

	[root@rhel3 ~]# yum install libvirt-client

Now for using **virsh**:

	[root@rhel3 ~]# virsh
	Welcome to virsh, the virtualization interactive terminal.
	
	Type:  'help' for help with commands
		   'quit' to quit

### Networking with libvirt

From the Virtualization Host Configuration and Guest Installation Guide:

> #### Network Address Translation (NAT) with libvirt
>
> One of the most common methods for sharing network connections is to use Network Address Translation (NAT) forwarding (also known as virtual networks).
>
> **Host configuration**
>
> Every standard libvirt installation provides NAT-based connectivity to virtual machines as the default virtual network. Verify that it is available with the `virsh net-list --all` command.
>
> 	# virsh net-list --all
> 	Name                 State      Autostart
> 	-----------------------------------------
> 	default              active     yes
>
> If it is missing, the example XML configuration file can be reloaded and activated:
>
> 	# virsh net-define /usr/share/libvirt/networks/default.xml
>
> The default network is defined from **/usr/share/libvirt/networks/default.xml**
>
> Mark the default network to automatically start:
>
> 	# virsh net-autostart default
> 	Network default marked as autostarted
>
> Start the default network:
>
> 	# virsh net-start default
> 	Network default started
>
> Once the libvirt default network is running, you will see an isolated bridge device. This device does not have any physical interfaces added. The new device uses NAT and IP forwarding to connect to the physical network. Do not add new interfaces.
>
> 	# brctl show
> 	bridge name     bridge id               STP enabled     interfaces
> 	virbr0          8000.000000000000       yes
>
> **libvirt** adds **iptables** rules which allow traffic to and from guest virtual machines attached to the **virbr0** device in the **INPUT**, **FORWARD**, **OUTPUT** and **POSTROUTING** chains. **libvirt** then attempts to enable the **ip_forward** parameter. Some other applications may disable **ip_forward**, so the best option is to add the following to **/etc/sysctl.conf**.
>
> 	net.ipv4.ip_forward = 1
>
> **Guest virtual machine configuration**
>
> Once the host configuration is complete, a guest virtual machine can be connected to the virtual network based on its name. To connect a guest to the '**default**' virtual network, the following could be used in the XML configuration file (such as **/etc/libvirtd/qemu/myguest.xml**) for the guest:
>
> 	<interface type='network'>
> 	   <source network='default'/>
> 	</interface>
>
> #### Bridged networking with libvirt
>
> Bridged networking (also known as physical device sharing) is used to dedicate a physical device to a virtual machine. Bridging is often used for more advanced setups and on servers with multiple network interfaces.
>
> To create a bridge (**br0**) based on the **eth0** interface, execute the following command on the host:
>
> 	# virsh iface-bridge eth0 br0
>
> **Important**
>
> NetworkManager does not support bridging. NetworkManager must be disabled to use networking with the network scripts (located in the **/etc/sysconfig/network-scripts/** directory).
>
> 	# chkconfig NetworkManager off
> 	# chkconfig network on
> 	# service NetworkManager stop
> 	# service network start
>
> If you do not want to disable NetworkManager entirely, add "**NM_CONTROLLED=no**" to the **ifcfg-*** network script being used for the bridge.
>

### VM Images and Installation Locations

From the Virtualization_Administration_Guide:

> Use a central location for virtual machine installations and images. Virtual machine images should be stored under **/var/lib/libvirt/images/**. If you are using a different directory for your virtual machine images make sure you add the directory to your SELinux policy and relabel it before starting the installation. Use of shareable, network storage in a central location is highly recommended.

and from the Virtualization_Host_Configuration_and_Guest_Installation_Guide:

> For ISO image files and guest storage images, the recommended location to use is **/var/lib/libvirt/images**/. Any other location may require additional configuration by SELinux.

### Libvirt Networking and VM Image Location Example

Let's make sure the default network is automatically configured:

	[root@rhel3 ~]# virsh -c qemu:///system net-list
	Name                 State      Autostart     Persistent
	--------------------------------------------------
	default              active     yes           yes

Now let's make sure it's assigned to a bridge:

	[root@rhel3 ~]# virsh -c qemu:///system net-info default
	Name            default
	UUID            8405fc50-ead0-4afb-85bc-9baf521c2e27
	Active:         yes
	Persistent:     yes
	Autostart:      yes
	Bridge:         virbr0

Then install **bridge-utils** and check the bridge:

	[root@rhel3 ~]# yum install bridge-utils
	[root@rhel3 ~]# brctl show
	bridge name	bridge id		STP enabled	interfaces
	virbr0		8000.525400e08ccf	yes		virbr0-nic

Here are the firewall rules that were added by the **libvirt** package:

	[root@rhel3 ~]# iptables -L -n -v
	Chain INPUT (policy ACCEPT 0 packets, 0 bytes)
	 pkts bytes target     prot opt in     out     source               destination
		0     0 ACCEPT     udp  --  virbr0 *       0.0.0.0/0            0.0.0.0/0           udp dpt:53

	Chain FORWARD (policy ACCEPT 0 packets, 0 bytes)
	 pkts bytes target     prot opt in     out     source               destination
		0     0 ACCEPT     all  --  *      virbr0  0.0.0.0/0            192.168.122.0/24    state RELATED,ESTABLISHED
		0     0 ACCEPT     all  --  virbr0 *       192.168.122.0/24     0.0.0.0/0
		0     0 ACCEPT     all  --  virbr0 virbr0  0.0.0.0/0            0.0.0.0/0

	Chain OUTPUT (policy ACCEPT 1593 packets, 241K bytes)
	 pkts bytes target     prot opt in     out     source               destination

And here is the **nat** table:

	[root@rhel3 ~]# iptables -L -n -v -t nat
	Chain PREROUTING (policy ACCEPT 73 packets, 14236 bytes)
	 pkts bytes target     prot opt in     out     source               destination
	
	Chain POSTROUTING (policy ACCEPT 12 packets, 699 bytes)
	 pkts bytes target     prot opt in     out     source               destination
		0     0 MASQUERADE  tcp  --  *      *       192.168.122.0/24    !192.168.122.0/24    masq ports: 1024-65535
		0     0 MASQUERADE  udp  --  *      *       192.168.122.0/24    !192.168.122.0/24    masq ports: 1024-65535
		0     0 MASQUERADE  all  --  *      *       192.168.122.0/24    !192.168.122.0/24
	
	Chain OUTPUT (policy ACCEPT 12 packets, 699 bytes)
	 pkts bytes target     prot opt in     out     source               destination

I was okay with the NAT approach for now. I also wanted to make sure the **ip_forward** flag was applied:

	[root@rhel3 ~]# cat /proc/sys/net/ipv4/ip_forward
	0
	[root@rhel3 ~]# grep ip_forward /etc/sysctl.conf
	net.ipv4.ip_forward = 0

and it actually wasn't for some reason, so I set the above value to 1 and then ran the following to apply the change:

	[root@rhel3 ~]# sysctl -p
	net.ipv4.ip_forward = 1
	net.ipv4.conf.default.rp_filter = 1
	net.ipv4.conf.default.accept_source_route = 0
	kernel.sysrq = 0
	kernel.core_uses_pid = 1
	net.ipv4.tcp_syncookies = 1
	net.bridge.bridge-nf-call-ip6tables = 0
	net.bridge.bridge-nf-call-iptables = 0
	net.bridge.bridge-nf-call-arptables = 0
	kernel.msgmnb = 65536
	kernel.msgmax = 65536
	kernel.shmmax = 68719476736
	kernel.shmall = 4294967296

Now checking the setting:

	[root@rhel3 ~]# cat /proc/sys/net/ipv4/ip_forward
	1

That's better.

It sounds like we need to use the **/var/lib/libvirt/images** directory for storing ISOs and virtual disks. Let's make sure it exists and has approproate *selinux* context:

	[root@rhel3 ~]# ls -dZ /var/lib/libvirt/images
	drwx--x--x. root root system_u:object_r:virt_image_t:s0 /var/lib/libvirt/images

That looks good. I copied a centos ISO in there which I will use for my VM install later:

	[root@rhel3 ~]# rsync -avzP 192.168.1.101:/data/isos/centos/CentOS-6.5-x86_64-minimal.iso /var/lib/libvirt/images/.
	Password:

	sent 11 bytes  received 62 bytes  29.20 bytes/sec
	total size is 417333248  speedup is 5716893.81

### VM Graphical framebuffers

From the Virtualization_Administration_Guide:

> A graphics device allows for graphical interaction with the guest virtual machine OS. A guest virtual machine will typically have either a framebuffer or a text console configured to allow interaction with the admin.
>
> To specify the graphical framebuffer devices configuration settings, use a management tool to make the following changes to the domain XML:
>
> 	<devices>
> 	   <graphics type='sdl' display=':0.0'/>
> 	   <graphics type='vnc' port='5904'>
> 	      <listen type='address' address='1.2.3.4'/>
> 	   </graphics>
> 	  <graphics type='rdp' autoport='yes' multiUser='yes' />
> 	  <graphics type='desktop' fullscreen='yes'/>
> 	  <graphics type='spice'>
> 	    <listen type='network' network='rednet'/>
> 	 </graphics>
> 	 </devices>
>
> The graphics element has a mandatory type attribute which takes the value **sdl**, **vnc**, **rdp** or **desktop** as explained below:
>
> **Graphical framebuffer elements**
>
> {:.kt}
> | Parameter	| Description|
> |:----------------|:----------------|
> | sdl	| This displays a window on the host physical machine desktop, it can take 3 optional arguments: a display attribute for the **display** to use, an **xauth** attribute for the authentication identifier, and an optional fullscreen attribute accepting values **yes** or **no**|
> |vnc|	 Starts a VNC server. The port attribute specifies the TCP port number (with -1 as legacy syntax indicating that it should be auto-allocated). The autoport attribute is the new preferred syntax for indicating autoallocation of the TCP port to use. The listen attribute is an IP address for the server to listen on. The passwd attribute provides a VNC password in clear text. The keymap attribute specifies the keymap to use. It is possible to set a limit on the validity of the password be giving an timestamp **passwdValidTo='2010-04-09T15:51:00'** assumed to be in UTC. The **connected** attribute allows control of connected client during password changes. VNC accepts keep value only and note that it may not be supported by all hypervisors. Rather than using listen/port, QEMU supports a socket attribute for listening on a unix domain socket path.|
> |spice|	 Starts a SPICE server. The port attribute specifies the TCP port number (with -1 as legacy syntax indicating that it should be auto-allocated), while tlsPort gives an alternative secure port number. The autoport attribute is the new preferred syntax for indicating auto-allocation of both port numbers. The listen attribute is an IP address for the server to listen on. The passwd attribute provides a SPICE password in clear text. The keymap attribute specifies the keymap to use. It is possible to set a limit on the validity of the password be giving an timestamp passwdValidTo='2010-04-09T15:51:00' assumed to be in UTC. The connected attribute allows control of connected client during password changes. SPICE accepts keep to keep client connected, disconnect to disconnect client and fail to fail changing password. Note it is not be supported by all hypervisors. The defaultMode attribute sets the default channel security policy, valid values are secure, insecure and the default any (which is secure if possible, but falls back to insecure rather than erroring out if no secure path is available).|

### Prepare firewall for VNC Example

I will just use VNC to connect to the VM's console. If I am going to do that, I will need to open up the firewall to allow **5900-5910** at least for testing. We actually covered this in [Chapter 13](/2014/03/rhcsa-rhce-chapter-13-remote-access/). Here is the command to do that:

	[root@rhel3 ~]# iptables -I INPUT 8 -m state --state NEW -m tcp -p tcp --dport 5900:5910 -j ACCEPT
	[root@rhel3 ~]# service iptables save
	iptables: Saving firewall rules to /etc/sysconfig/iptables:[  OK  ]

If you want to use the SPICE protocol, check out my previous post [here](/2013/04/deploying-a-test-windows-environment-in-a-kvm-infrastucture/).

### Creating guests with virt-install

From the Virtualization_Host_Configuration_and_Guest_Installation_Guide:

> You can use the **virt-install** command to create guest virtual machines from the command line. **virt-install** is used either interactively or as part of a script to automate the creation of virtual machines. Using **virt-install** with Kickstart files allows for unattended installation of virtual machines.
>
> The **virt-install** tool provides a number of options that can be passed on the command line. To see a complete list of options run the following command:
>
> 	# virt-install --help
>
> Note that you need root privileges in order for **virt-install** commands to complete successfully. The **virt-install** man page also documents each command option and important variables.

### Creating a VM with virt-install Example

First let's install the utility:

	[root@rhel3 ~]# yum install python-virtinst

Here is a command that will create the VM:

	[root@rhel3 ~]# virt-install --name=centos --ram=512 --vcpus=1 --cdrom=/var/lib/libvirt/images/CentOS-6.5-x86_64-minimal.iso --os-type=linux --os-variant=rhel6 --disk=/var/lib/libvirt/images/centos.img,size=5 --network network=default --graphics=vnc,listen=0.0.0.0,keymap=en-us --noautoconsole
	
	Starting install...
	Allocating 'centos.img'                                                                                         | 5.0 GB     00:00
	Creating domain...                                                                                              |    0 B     00:00
	Domain installation still in progress. You can reconnect to
	the console to complete the installation process.

Now make sure the VM is running:

	[root@rhel3 ~]# virsh list
	 Id    Name                           State
	----------------------------------------------------
	 1     centos                         running

Now find the *vncdisplay* assigned to the VM:

	[root@rhel3 ~]# virsh vncdisplay 1
	127.0.0.1:0
	
	[root@rhel3 ~]# netstat -ant | grep 590
	tcp        0      0 0.0.0.0:5900                0.0.0.0:*                   LISTEN

Looks like it's just **5900**.  Now let's install **virt-viewer**:

	[root@rhel3 ~]# yum install virt-viewer xauth xorg-x11-fonts-Type1

and reconnect to our host with X-forwarding:

	elatov@fed:~$ssh -X rhel3 -l root
	root@rhel3's password:
	Last login: Sat May 24 18:04:13 2014 from fed.local.com
	/usr/bin/xauth:  creating new authority file /root/.Xauthority
	[root@rhel3 ~]# virt-viewer 1

and you should see the following:

![virt-viewer-launched-x-forward](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/elatov/upload/master/rhce_p22/virt-viewer-launched-x-forward.png)

From there we can just finish the install. Let's stop there, shutdown the VM, and delete it:

	[root@rhel3 ~]# virsh
	Welcome to virsh, the virtualization interactive terminal.
	
	Type:  'help' for help with commands
		   'quit' to quit
	
	virsh # list
	 Id    Name                           State
	----------------------------------------------------
	 1     centos                         running
	
	virsh # destroy 1
	Domain 1 destroyed
	
	virsh # list --all
	 Id    Name                           State
	----------------------------------------------------
	 -     centos                         shut off
	
	virsh # undefine centos
	Domain centos has been undefined

Lastly remove the disk image file that was created for the VM:

	[root@rhel3 ~]# rm /var/lib/libvirt/images/centos.img
	rm: remove regular file '/var/lib/libvirt/images/centos.img'? y

Since I started the VNC server for the VM on **0.0.0.0** (remote and not just local), I could connect to the VM from a remote machine using a regular vnc client:

	elatov@fed:~$vncviewer rhel3:0
	
	TigerVNC Viewer 64-bit v1.3.0 (20140319)
	Built on Mar 19 2014 at 17:09:18

	 CConn:       connected to host rhel3 port 5900
	 CConnection: Server supports RFB protocol version 3.8
	 CConnection: Using RFB protocol version 3.8

	 CConn:       Using pixel format depth 24 (32bpp) little-endian rgb888
	 CConn:       Using Tight encoding
	 Viewport:    Unexpected release of FLTK key code 65293 (0xff0d)

and you will again see the same window:

![vncviewer-connected-to-kvm-vm](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/elatov/upload/master/rhce_p22/vncviewer-connected-to-kvm-vm.png)

If you are always able to SSH forward then might as well do that for security reasons, and then you can close the **5900** ports in the firewall. This was just for demostration purposes.

### Creating guests with virt-manager

From the Virtualization_Host_Configuration_and_Guest_Installation_Guide:

> **virt-manager**, also known as Virtual Machine Manager, is a graphical tool for creating and managing guest virtual machines.
>
> **Creating a guest virtual machine with virt-manager**
>
>  1. Open virt-manager
>
>	Start **virt-manager**. Launch the **Virtual Machine Manager** application from the **Applications** menu and **System Tools** submenu. Alternatively, run the **virt-manager** command as root.
>
>  2. Optional: Open a remote hypervisor
>
>	Select the hypervisor and click the **Connect** button to connect to the remote hypervisor.
>
>  3. Create a new virtual machine
>
>	The **virt-manager** window allows you to create a new virtual machine. Click the **Create a new virtual** machine button to open the New VM wizard.
>
>	![virt-man-p1](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/elatov/upload/master/rhce_p22/virt-man-p1.png)
>
>	The New VM wizard breaks down the virtual machine creation process into five steps:
>
>	1. Naming the guest virtual machine and choosing the installation type
>	2. Locating and configuring the installation media
>	3. Configuring memory and CPU options
>	4. Configuring the virtual machine's storage
>	5. Configuring networking, architecture, and other hardware settings
>
>	Ensure that virt-manager can access the installation media (whether locally or over the network) before you continue.
>
>  4. Specify name and installation type
>
>	The guest virtual machine creation process starts with the selection of a name and installation type. Virtual machine names can have underscores (_), periods (.), and hyphens (-).
>
>	![virt-man-p2](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/elatov/upload/master/rhce_p22/virt-man-p2.png)
>
>	Type in a virtual machine name and choose an installation type:
>
>	- **Local install media** (ISO image or CDROM) - This method uses a CD-ROM, DVD, or image of an installation disk (for example, .iso).
>	- **Network Install** (HTTP, FTP, or NFS) - This method involves the use of a mirrored Red Hat Enterprise Linux or Fedora installation tree to install a guest. The installation tree must be accessible through either HTTP, FTP, or NFS.
>	- **Network Boot** (PXE) - This method uses a Preboot eXecution Environment (PXE) server to install the guest virtual machine. To install via network boot, the guest must have a routable IP address or shared network device.
>	- **Import existing disk image** - This method allows you to create a new guest virtual machine and import a disk image (containing a pre-installed, bootable operating system) to it.
>
>	Click Forward to continue.
>
>  5. Configure installation
>
>	Next, configure the **OS type** and **Version** of the installation. Ensure that you select the appropriate OS type for your virtual machine. Depending on the method of installation, provide the install URL or existing storage path.
>

>
>	![virt-man-p4](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/elatov/upload/master/rhce_p22/virt-man-p4.png)
>
>  6. Configure CPU and memory
>
>	The next step involves configuring the number of CPUs and amount of memory to allocate to the virtual machine. The wizard shows the number of CPUs and amount of memory you can allocate; configure these settings and click **Forward**.
>
>	![virt-man-p5](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/elatov/upload/master/rhce_p22/virt-man-p5.png)
>
>  7. Configure storage
>
>	Assign storage to the guest virtual machine.
>
>	![virt-man-p5-5.png](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/elatov/upload/master/rhce_p22/virt-man-p5-5.png)
>
>	If you chose to import an existing disk image during the first step, virt-manager will skip this step.
>
>	Assign sufficient space for your virtual machine and any applications it requires, then click Forward to continue.
>
>  8. Final configuration
>
>	Verify the settings of the virtual machine and click Finish when you are satisfied; doing so will create the virtual machine with default networking settings, virtualization type, and architecture.
>
>	![virt-man-p6](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/elatov/upload/master/rhce_p22/virt-man-p6.png)
>
> 	If you prefer to further configure the virtual machine's hardware first, check the **Customize configuration before install** box first before clicking **Finish**. Doing so will open another wizard that will allow you to add, remove, and configure the virtual machine's hardware settings.
>
>    After configuring the virtual machine's hardware, click **Apply**. **virt-manager** will then create the virtual machine with your specified hardware settings.

### Creating VM with virt-manager Example

First let's install the utlility:

	[root@rhel3 ~]# yum install virt-manager

Then launch the application if you are already using SSH X-Forwaring, if not, relogin with ssh enabling X-Forwaring (**ssh -X**).

	[root@rhel3 ~]# virt-manager
	process 11006: D-Bus library appears to be incorrectly set up; failed to read machine uuid: Failed to open "/var/lib/dbus/machine-id": No such file or directory
	See the manual page for dbus-uuidgen to correct this issue.
	  D-Bus not built with -rdynamic so unable to print a backtrace
	Aborted

Initially I ran into issue launching that. It turns out this is a know issue and there was a bug filed on it. Here is [link](https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=598200) to the bug, to fix the issue, just run the following:

	[root@rhel3 ~]# dbus-uuidgen > /var/lib/dbus/machine-id

or the following:

	[root@rhel3 ~]# service messagebus start
	Starting system message bus:                               [  OK  ]

After that, it started up without issues:

	[root@rhel3 ~]# virt-manager
	[root@rhel3 ~]#

And I saw the following window:

![virt-man-launched](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/elatov/upload/master/rhce_p22/virt-man-launched.png)

We can see that is already connected to the qemu system, which is great. Now let's click "New" and you should see the following pop up:

![virt-man-new-vm-p1](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/elatov/upload/master/rhce_p22/virt-man-new-vm-p1.png)

**Name** the VM, select **Local install media**, and click **Forward**. On the next page, choose to point to an ISO and upon clicking on that you will see the default volume (**/var/lib/libvirt/images**). From there you can select the ISO:

![virt-man-select-centos-iso](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/elatov/upload/master/rhce_p22/virt-man-select-centos-iso.png)

Then select the **OS Type** and **Version**. After done, it should look like this:

![virt-man-os-selected](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/elatov/upload/master/rhce_p22/virt-man-os-selected.png)

Click **Forward**, select **RAM** and **CPU** settings, it should look like this:

![virt-man-ram-cpu-settings](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/elatov/upload/master/rhce_p22/virt-man-ram-cpu-settings.png)

Click Forward and select the disk size:

![virt-man-vm-disk-size](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/elatov/upload/master/rhce_p22/virt-man-vm-disk-size.png)

Click Forward and you should see the final page:

![virt-man-final-page](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/elatov/upload/master/rhce_p22/virt-man-final-page.png)

Upon clicking **Finish** you will see the console of the VM:

![virt-man-console-open-after-install](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/elatov/upload/master/rhce_p22/virt-man-console-open-after-install.png)

You will also see the VM in the Virt-Manager's Inventory:

![virt-man-centos-running](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/elatov/upload/master/rhce_p22/virt-man-centos-running.png)

If you proceed with the VM install, here is how the disk setup page will look like:

![virt-man-centos-install-disk-page](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/elatov/upload/master/rhce_p22/virt-man-centos-install-disk-page.png)

After the install is finished, you will see the OS booted up:

![virt-man-os-booted](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/elatov/upload/master/rhce_p22/virt-man-os-booted.png)

You can also check on the KVM host it self to see all the parameters passed to the **qemu-kvm** binary when it starts up the VM, by checking out the VM specific logs that **libvirt** generates:

	[root@rhel3 ~]# tail -3 /var/log/libvirt/qemu/centos.log
	2014-05-25 01:12:47.827+0000: starting up

	char device redirected to /dev/pts/3

To find out the IP of the VM you can do a couple of things. First you can find the MAC address of the VM, with the following command:

	[root@rhel3 ~]# virsh list
	 Id    Name                           State
	----------------------------------------------------
	 4     centos                         running
	
	[root@rhel3 ~]# virsh domiflist 4
	Interface  Type       Source     Model       MAC
	-------------------------------------------------------
	vnet0      network    default    virtio      52:54:00:69:0c:ab


**libvirt** uses **dnsmasq** for it's DHCP services, and all the leases are under **/var/lib/libvirt/dnsmasq/default.leases**. You can check the process table to see how dnsmasq was started:

	[root@rhel3 ~]# ps -eaf | grep dnsma
	nobody    2096     1  0 May24 ?        00:00:00 /usr/sbin/dnsmasq --strict-order --local=// --domain-needed --pid-file=/var/run/libvirt/network/default.pid --conf-file= --except-interface lo --bind-interfaces --listen-address 192.168.122.1 --dhcp-range 192.168.122.2,192.168.122.254 --dhcp-leasefile=/var/lib/libvirt/dnsmasq/default.leases --dhcp-lease-max=253 --dhcp-no-override --dhcp-hostsfile=/var/lib/libvirt/dnsmasq/default.hostsfile --addn-hosts=/var/lib/libvirt/dnsmasq/default.addnhosts

And **/var/log/messages**, will show all the DHCP leases as well:

	[root@rhel3 log]# tail -4 messages
	May 25 11:18:16 rhel3 dnsmasq-dhcp[2096]: DHCPREQUEST(virbr0) 192.168.122.85 52:54:00:69:0c:ab
	May 25 11:18:16 rhel3 dnsmasq-dhcp[2096]: DHCPACK(virbr0) 192.168.122.85 52:54:00:69:0c:ab
	May 25 11:40:38 rhel3 dnsmasq-dhcp[2096]: DHCPREQUEST(virbr0) 192.168.122.85 52:54:00:69:0c:ab
	May 25 11:40:38 rhel3 dnsmasq-dhcp[2096]: DHCPACK(virbr0) 192.168.122.85 52:54:00:69:0c:ab

But we can just check out the file to see what our current DHCP leases are:

	[root@rhel3 ~]# cat /var/lib/libvirt/dnsmasq/default.leases
	1400985508 52:54:00:69:0c:ab 192.168.122.85 * *

We only one have now, but if you had multiple address, you could run the following little **bash** command to track down your VM:

	[root@rhel3 ~]# for mac in `virsh domiflist centos |grep -o -E "([0-9a-f]{2}:){5}([0-9a-f]{2})"`; do grep $mac /var/lib/libvirt/dnsmasq/default.leases; done | awk '{print $3}'
	192.168.122.85
	[root@rhel3 ~]#

We can confirm by checking out the console:

![ip-command-within-the-vm-virt-man](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/elatov/upload/master/rhce_p22/ip-command-within-the-vm-virt-man.png)

Or logging in via SSH from the host it self:

	[root@rhel3 ~]# ssh 192.168.122.85 -l root
	The authenticity of host '192.168.122.85 (192.168.122.85)' can't be established.

	Are you sure you want to continue connecting (yes/no)? yes
	Warning: Permanently added '192.168.122.85' (RSA) to the list of known hosts.

		inet 192.168.122.85/24 brd 192.168.122.255 scope global eth0

Lastly to make sure the NAT is working properly, check to see that you can reach the outside network from the VM itself:

	[root@localhost ~]# ping google.com -c 3
	PING google.com (74.125.239.100) 56(84) bytes of data.
	64 bytes from nuq05s01-in-f4.1e100.net (74.125.239.100): icmp_seq=1 ttl=53 time=41.1 ms

Everything looks good.
