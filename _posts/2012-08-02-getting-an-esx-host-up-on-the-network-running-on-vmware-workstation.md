I was recently setting up an ESX and ESXi host on my local VMware Workstation, however whatever I tried I couldn't get the ESX host to reply to pings. I setup the ESX and ESXi host to use the NAT network from the VMware Workstation. Here is how the NAT settings looked like from the Virtual Network Editor:

![Virtual_network_Editor](https://github.com/elatov/uploads/raw/master/2012/04/Virtual_network_Editor.png)

Here is the local interface on my laptop that is used for the NAT.

	[elatov@klaptop ~]$ ifconfig vmnet1
	vmnet1    Link encap:Ethernet  HWaddr 00:50:56:C0:00:01
	          inet addr:10.0.1.1  Bcast:10.0.1.255  Mask:255.255.255.0
	          inet6 addr: fe80::250:56ff:fec0:1/64 Scope:Link
	          UP BROADCAST RUNNING MULTICAST  MTU:1500  Metric:1
	          RX packets:0 errors:0 dropped:0 overruns:0 frame:0
	          TX packets:24 errors:0 dropped:0 overruns:0 carrier:0
	          collisions:0 txqueuelen:1000
	          RX bytes:0 (0.0 b)  TX bytes:0 (0.0 b)


Running a ping test from the ESX host just resulted in failures like so:

	[root@localhost ~]# ping -c 2 10.0.1.1
	PING 10.0.1.1 (10.0.1.1) 56(84) bytes of data.
	From 10.0.1.130 icmp_seq=1 Destination Host Unreachable
	From 10.0.1.130 icmp_seq=2 Destination Host Unreachable

	--- 10.0.1.1 ping statistics ---
	2 packets transmitted, 0 received, +2 errors, 100% packet loss, time 1008ms


Here is how the network setup looked like inside the ESX host:

	[root@localhost ~]# route -n
	Kernel IP routing table
	Destination     Gateway         Genmask         Flags Metric Ref    Use Iface
	10.0.1.0        0.0.0.0         255.255.255.0   U     0      0        0 vswif0
	169.254.0.0     0.0.0.0         255.255.0.0     U     0      0        0 vswif0
	0.0.0.0         10.0.1.1        0.0.0.0         UG    0      0        0 vswif0

	[root@localhost ~]# esxcfg-vswif -l

So I just set a static IP of 10.0.1.130 with the default gateway of 10.0.1.1 and I am utilizing one uplink, which is the e1000 NIC (the 10.0.1.130 IP falls under the NAT network that I had defined). Doing a **tcpdump** on the **vmnet1** interface during my ping test from above, I saw the following.

	[elatov@klaptop ~]$ sudo tcpdump -i vmnet1 -nne
	tcpdump: verbose output suppressed, use -v or -vv for full protocol decode
	listening on vmnet1, link-type EN10MB (Ethernet), capture size 65535 bytes

	6 packets captured
	6 packets received by filter
	0 packets dropped by kernel


So the vswif interface is ARP'ing out to find out the mac address of it's default gateway, and the **vmnet1** interface is responding to the the request but the **vswif0** interface is not getting it.

Now my ESXi host worked without any issues. Here is how the network looks like for the ESXi host:

	~ # esxcfg-vmknic -l
	Interface Port_Group         IP_Address Netmask       Broadcast  MAC Address       MTU  Enabled Type
	vmk0      Management Network 10.0.1.128 255.255.255.0 10.0.1.255 00:0c:29:2c:54:17 1500 true    STATIC

	~ # esxcfg-nics -l
	Name   PCI    Driver Link Speed    Duplex MAC Address       MTU  Description
	vmnic0 02:00  e1000  Up   1000Mbps Full   00:0c:29:2c:54:17 1500 Intel PRO/1000 MT Single Port Adapter


So my ESXi host had the IP of 10.0.1.128, which also falls under my NAT network. Now whenever I did a ping test from the ESXi host, I saw the following:

	~ # vmkping -c 2 10.0.1.1
	PING 10.0.1.1 (10.0.1.1): 56 data bytes
	64 bytes from 10.0.1.1: icmp_seq=0 ttl=64 time=0.337 ms
	64 bytes from 10.0.1.1: icmp_seq=1 ttl=64 time=6.532 ms

	--- 10.0.1.1 ping statistics ---
	2 packets transmitted, 2 packets received, 0% packet loss
	round-trip min/avg/max = 0.337/3.434/6.532 ms


It worked just fine. Now looking at the packet capture as the pings were going, I saw the following:

	[elatov@klaptop ~]$ sudo tcpdump -i vmnet1 -nne
	tcpdump: verbose output suppressed, use -v or -vv for full protocol decode
	listening on vmnet1, link-type EN10MB (Ethernet), capture size 65535 bytes
	16:17:22.749184 00:0c:29:2c:54:17 > 00:50:56:c0:00:01, ethertype IPv4 (0x0800), length 98: 10.0.1.128 > 10.0.1.1: ICMP echo request, id 52787, seq 0, length 64
	16:17:22.749227 00:50:56:c0:00:01 > 00:0c:29:2c:54:17, ethertype IPv4 (0x0800), length 98: 10.0.1.1 > 10.0.1.128: ICMP echo reply, id 52787, seq 0, length 64
	16:17:23.750021 00:0c:29:2c:54:17 > 00:50:56:c0:00:01, ethertype IPv4 (0x0800), length 98: 10.0.1.128 > 10.0.1.1: ICMP echo request, id 52787, seq 1, length 64
	16:17:23.750079 00:50:56:c0:00:01 > 00:0c:29:2c:54:17, ethertype IPv4 (0x0800), length 98: 10.0.1.1 > 10.0.1.128: ICMP echo reply, id 52787, seq 1, length 64


Looking at the packet captures I noticed that the ESXi host was using the following MAC address: **00:0c:29**:2c:54:17 but looking at the ESX host it is using the following mac address: **00:50:56**:4c:e5:09. You will notice the ESX host is using it's typical virtual MAC address starting with **00:50:56**. Where the ESXi host is using the "physical" MAC address that was assigned to it. The physical mac address assigned to the ESX host can be seen from the **esxcfg-nics** output:

	[root@localhost ~]# esxcfg-nics -l
	Name   PCI   Driver Link Speed    Duplex MAC Address MTU Description
	vmnic0 02:01 e1000  Up   1000Mbps Full **00:0c:29:d3:3d:34** 1500 Intel PRO/1000 MT Single Port Adapt.


Now looking at the MAC Address of the **vswif0** interface, we see the following:

	[root@localhost ~]# ifconfig vswif0
	vswif0    Link encap:Ethernet  HWaddr **00:50:56:4C:E5:09**
	          inet addr:10.0.1.130  Bcast:10.0.1.255  Mask:255.255.255.0
	          UP BROADCAST RUNNING MULTICAST  MTU:1500  Metric:1
	          RX packets:1 errors:0 dropped:0 overruns:0 frame:0
	          TX packets:27 errors:0 dropped:0 overruns:0 carrier:0
	          collisions:0 txqueuelen:1000
	          RX bytes:60 (60.0 b)  TX bytes:1158 (1.1 KiB)


Now looking at the ESXi host, we see the following:

	~ # esxcfg-nics -l
	Name   PCI    Driver Link Speed    Duplex MAC Address       MTU  Description
	vmnic0 02:00  e1000  Up   1000Mbps Full   ->00:0c:29:2c:54:17<- 1500 Intel PRO/1000 MT Single Port Adapter


The **vmnic0** MAC is the physical MAC address assigned to the ESXi host. Now looking at the MAC address of the **vmk** interface used for management I saw the following:

	# esxcfg-vmknic -l
	Interface Port_Group         IP_Address Netmask       Broadcast  MAC Address       MTU  Enabled Type
	vmk0      Management Network 10.0.1.128 255.255.255.0 10.0.1.255 ->00:0c:29:2c:54:17<- 1500 true    STATIC


So the management interface of the ESXi host uses the same MAC as the physical NIC. Where on the ESX host the management interface creates a virtual MAC address and uses that. This is actually expected and per KB [1031111](https://knowledge.broadcom.com/external/article?legacyId=1031111) you can change the behavior with a setting.

So for security reasons VMware workstation is not allowing to send traffic with a MAC address other than what is assigned to the VM. I found a couple web pages which described how to get around the issue: 

* [VMware KB 1008473](https://knowledge.broadcom.com/external/article?legacyId=1008473)
* [VMware Communities 184111](http://communities.vmware.com/thread/184111)
* [sanbarrow](http://sanbarrow.com/vmx/vmx-network-advanced.html)

Supposedly setting the optionÂ *ethernetX.noForgedSrcAddr* to *False* should allow for MAC Address changes. I tried setting that option and many others, but whatever I tried to put into the VMX file of the ESX host VM, it would not work. So I just enabled **Allow Forged Trasmits** on the virtual switch where **vswif0** was on and it worked out for me.
