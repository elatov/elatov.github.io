From [VMware KB 2040405](https://knowledge.broadcom.com/external/article?legacyId=2040405) I saw that we can now get SMART attributes from local disks on an ESXi host. For example here is what I saw on the Mac Mini with the SSD:

	~ # esxcli storage core device smart get -d t10.ATA_____APPLE_SSD_SM256E________________________S1AANYNF302924______
	Parameter                     Value  Threshold  Worst
	----------------------------  -----  ---------  -----
	Health Status                 OK     N/A        N/A
	Media Wearout Indicator       N/A    N/A        N/A
	Write Error Count             N/A    N/A        N/A
	Read Error Count              200    0          200
	Power-on Hours                99     0          99
	Power Cycle Count             99     0          99
	Reallocated Sector Count      100    0          100
	Raw Read Error Rate           200    0          200
	Drive Temperature             60     0          42
	Driver Rated Max Temperature  N/A    N/A        N/A
	Write Sectors TOT Count       200    0          200
	Read Sectors TOT Count        N/A    N/A        N/A
	Initial Bad Block Count       N/A    N/A        N/A

Since I was already monitoring the ESXi host with Zabbix, I decided to modify the host and add an item to monitor the SSD Temperature. Most of the configuration for this is covered in [Zabbix SSH checks](https://www.zabbix.com/documentation/2.0/manual/config/items/itemtypes/ssh_checks). First let's craft a command to only return the numeric value of the Temperature Attribute:

	elatov@kerch:~$ssh root@macm esxcli storage core device smart get -d t10.ATA_____APPLE_SSD_SM256E________________________S1AANYNF302924______ | grep 'Drive Temperature' | awk '{print $3}'
	60

After that, we can create a new item for that host with the following configuration:

![zabbix-ssh-check-smart_g](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/elatov/upload/master/zabbix-ssh-command-esxi/zabbix-ssh-check-smart_g.png)

If you want you can also specify an SSH key for the connection as well, but for that to work, the zabbix user must have an existing home directory (check out  [Zabbix SSH checks](https://www.zabbix.com/documentation/2.0/manual/config/items/itemtypes/ssh_checks) for more information). Looking over some of the SSDs, for example from [Samsung SSD 840 PRO Series Data Sheet](http://www.samsung.com/global/business/semiconductor/Downloads/DataSheet-Samsung_SSD_840_PRO_Rev12.pdf) :

> {:.kt}
> | Temperature | |
> |:-----|:--|
> |Operating:|  0째C to 70째C |
> |Non-Operating: | -55째C to 95째C|

I decided to create a trigger for the temperature item to kick off if it ever reaches anything above 70:

![zabbix-trigger-high-ssd-temp_g](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/elatov/upload/master/zabbix-ssh-command-esxi/zabbix-trigger-high-ssd-temp_g.png)

Assigning a graph to that item and I am able to see the history of the SSD temperature:

![zabbix-graph-esxi-ssd-temp](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/elatov/upload/master/zabbix-ssh-command-esxi/zabbix-graph-esxi-ssd-temp.png)

If you want, you can obviously monitor other attributes as well.
