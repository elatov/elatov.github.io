I had a couple of use cases, let's try to cover them one by one.

## Sending Kubernetes Logs and events to Loki

There are instructions in [Send Kubernetes metrics, logs, and events to Grafana Cloud with Helm and Argo CD](https://grafana.com/docs/grafana-cloud/monitor-infrastructure/kubernetes-monitoring/configuration/configure-infrastructure-manually/argocd-config/). I was surprised to see an example for ArgoCD, but I was also really happy. Then I reviewed the [logs-only example](https://github.com/grafana/k8s-monitoring-helm/tree/main/examples/logs-only) from grafana. The only thing I was missing was getting the right version of the helm chart. It was actually one behind from the releases in github. So I added the repo and checked with `helm`:

```bash
> helm repo add grafana https://grafana.github.io/helm-charts
> helm repo update
> helm search repo grafana/k8s-monitoring
NAME                      CHART VERSION    APP VERSION    DESCRIPTION
grafana/k8s-monitoring    0.7.3            1.6.1          A Helm chart for gathering, scraping, and forwa...
```

Then I just created my ArgoCD application and after it deployed I saw all the pods in the cluster:

```bash
> k get po -l app.kubernetes.io/name=grafana-agent-logs
NAME                                                   READY   STATUS    RESTARTS   AGE
grafana-k8s-monitoring-home-grafana-agent-logs-7mgrw   2/2     Running   0          13m
grafana-k8s-monitoring-home-grafana-agent-logs-b8m6p   2/2     Running   0          13m
grafana-k8s-monitoring-home-grafana-agent-logs-kx7zs   2/2     Running   0          13m
```

I also learned a neat trick with ArgoCD, you can specify wild cards for versions and it will grab the latest version of the `helm` chart. It looks like there is a [github discussion](https://github.com/argoproj/argo-cd/discussions/12075) on that. After that's done you can search for your cluster and see the container logs:

![loki-container-logs.png](https://res.cloudinary.com/elatov/image/upload/v1591415062/blog-pics/loki-logs/loki-container-logs.png)

Then if you go a little further and add the `job="integrations/kubernetes/eventhandler"` label, you will only see the kubernetes events:

![loki-k8s-events-logs.png](https://res.cloudinary.com/elatov/image/upload/v1591415062/blog-pics/loki-logs/loki-k8s-events-logs.png)

## Sending Logs from Syslog clients

There is a [syslog source](https://grafana.com/docs/agent/latest/flow/reference/components/loki.source.syslog/) from Loki, and there are lot of good documentation on how to accomplish this with `promtail`:

- [Configure Promtail - Syslog](https://grafana.com/docs/loki/latest/send-data/promtail/configuration/#syslog)
- [Receiving logs From Syslog](https://grafana.com/docs/loki/latest/send-data/promtail/#receiving-logs-from-syslog)

It seems as though the `grafana agent` has replaced `promtail`. There is a nice discussion in this [github issue](https://github.com/grafana/agent/issues/1543). So I decided try to use `grafana agent` for this configuration. There is already a nice [grafana agent helm chart](https://github.com/grafana/agent/blob/main/operations/helm/charts/grafana-agent/values.yaml) and I saw a nice example of the configuration [here](https://github.com/brngates98/GrafanaAgents/blob/main/syslog/config.river). Using the same approach as above, I deployed that helm chart with ArgoCD and I had more `grafana agent` pods running in the same cluster:

```bash
> k get po -l app.kubernetes.io/instance=grafana-agent-home
NAME                       READY   STATUS    RESTARTS   AGE
grafana-agent-home-494k9   2/2     Running   0          2d16h
grafana-agent-home-hxnvn   2/2     Running   0          2d16h
grafana-agent-home-zfcwg   2/2     Running   0          2d16h
```

### Modifying rsyslog configuration to send RFC5424 format

As a quick test I added the following file on one my linux boxes:

```bash
> cat /etc/rsyslog.d/test-grafana.conf 
*.* @192.168.1.202
```

After enabling that, I saw a bunch of errors on the `grafana agent` pods:

```bash
> k logs grafana-agent-home-j5zf8 | tail
Defaulted container "grafana-agent" out of: grafana-agent, config-reloader
ts=2023-12-28T07:59:01.806692026Z level=warn msg="error parsing syslog stream" component=loki.source.syslog.syslog err="expecting a version value in the range 1-999 [col 4]"
ts=2023-12-28T07:59:02.812806196Z level=warn msg="error parsing syslog stream" component=loki.source.syslog.syslog err="expecting a version value in the range 1-999 [col 4]"
ts=2023-12-28T08:00:01.351971281Z level=warn msg="error parsing syslog stream" component=loki.source.syslog.syslog err="expecting a version value in the range 1-999 [col 4]"
ts=2023-12-28T08:00:01.356710055Z level=warn msg="error parsing syslog stream" component=loki.source.syslog.syslog err="expecting a version value in the range 1-999 [col 4]"
```

I needed to modify my `rsyslog` configuration to make sure it sends RFC5424 syslog format. After reading a couple of other sites

- [rsyslog github issue](https://github.com/rsyslog/rsyslog/issues/4749)
- [Event Forwarding â€“ using rsyslog](https://zrubi.hu/en/2022/event-forwarding-rsyslog/)

I had to add the following two options to my `/etc/rsyslog.conf` file:

```bash
input(type="imuxsock" socket="/dev/log" useSpecialParser="off")
module(load="builtin:omfile" Template="RSYSLOG_SyslogProtocol23Format")
```

After that the `grafana-agent` stopped throwing errors and I saw them getting forwarded to loki. Using a simple filter like this `{component="loki.source.syslog"}`, you should be able to see those logs:

![loki-syslog-logs.png](https://res.cloudinary.com/elatov/image/upload/v1591415062/blog-pics/loki-logs/loki-syslog-logs.png)

As a side note, it does looks like there may be support for RFC3164 syslog format soon based on this [github issue](https://github.com/grafana/agent/issues/5800)

## pfSense logs

When I tried to enable RFC5464 on the pfSense side:

![pfsense-syslog-format.png](https://res.cloudinary.com/elatov/image/upload/v1591415062/blog-pics/loki-logs/pfsense-syslog-format.png)

`grafana-agent` kept failing to parse the logs:

```bash
ts=2023-12-28T08:00:01.356710055Z level=warn msg="error parsing syslog stream" component=loki.source.syslog.syslog err="found EOF after \"
```

I found an old [loki issue](https://github.com/grafana/loki/issues/2232), but at this point I decided to deploy a syslog relay. There are some examples at:

- [How I fell in love with logs thanks to Grafana Loki](https://grafana.com/blog/2021/03/23/how-i-fell-in-love-with-logs-thanks-to-grafana-loki/)
- [grafana-loki-syslog-aio example](https://github.com/lux4rd0/grafana-loki-syslog-aio/blob/main/config/syslog-ng.conf)
- [Forwarding Syslog Messages to Loki via Promtail and syslog-ng with mTLS](https://eugenemdavis.net/forwarding-syslog-to-loki-mtls.html)
- [Using Rsyslog and Promtail to relay syslog messages to Loki](https://alexandre.deverteuil.net/post/syslog-relay-for-loki/)

On top of those the [Configuring syslog-ng relays](https://support.oneidentity.com/technical-documents/syslog-ng-open-source-edition/3.38/administration-guide/12#TOPIC-2026161) page was really helpful in getting the right config. I also decided to use the this [syslog-ng container](https://hub.docker.com/r/linuxserver/syslog-ng). It felt like it was the most up to date one. There are also helm charts available [here](https://github.com/syslog-ng/syslog-ng/tree/master/contrib/syslog-ng-helm-chart) it uses the [balabit container](https://hub.docker.com/r/balabit/syslog-ng/) which also seems like it's kept up to date.

After you deploy the pod, check out the `/config/log/current` file inside the container, it will tell you if anything is wrong with the `syslog-ng`config:

```bash
root@syslog-ng-77cccd8fdd-vsbj5:/# cd /config/log/
root@syslog-ng-77cccd8fdd-vsbj5:/config/log# cat current
2023-12-28 23:06:56.557137080  [2023-12-28T23:06:56.557108] ERROR: configuration files without a version number have become unsupported in syslog-ng 3.13, please specify a version number using @version as the first line in the configuration file;
2023-12-28 23:06:57.579632598  Error parsing config, syntax error, unexpected LL_IDENTIFIER, expecting '}' in /config/syslog-ng.conf:6:5-6:28:
2023-12-28 23:06:57.579636026  1       source s_local {
2023-12-28 23:06:57.579637181  2           internal();
2023-12-28 23:06:57.579638260  3       };
```

If all is well, you will see something like this:

```bash
root@syslog-ng-7f4dbd6cf5-jhbj8:/config/log# tail current
2023-12-28 23:42:08.681227564  [2023-12-28T23:42:08.681116] syslog-ng starting up; version='4.1.1'
2023-12-28 23:42:08.681287879  [2023-12-28T23:42:08.681225] Syslog connection established; fd='12', server='AF_INET(10.233.34.83:1514)', local='AF_INET(0.0.0.0:0)'
```

And you can see it was able to connect to the `grafana-agent` on port 1514 as well. Since I was forwarding the hostname with the `syslog-ng` pods, I was able to search by the hostname of my pfsense instance:

## Forwarding Journalctl Logs

Surprisingly `journalctl` doesn't support remote syslog. It's been a request for a a while now: [systemd issue 7170](https://github.com/systemd/systemd/issues/7170). Luckily `grafana agent` intergrates with that as well. I ended up using the approach for my `proxmox` host (this was briefly discussed at the [grafana community board](https://community.grafana.com/t/collecting-logs-from-proxmox/88472/2)). First install the agent following the [install docs](https://grafana.com/docs/agent/latest/flow/setup/install/linux/):

```bash
sudo mkdir -p /etc/apt/keyrings/
wget -q -O - https://apt.grafana.com/gpg.key | gpg --dearmor | sudo tee /etc/apt/keyrings/grafana.gpg > /dev/null
echo "deb [signed-by=/etc/apt/keyrings/grafana.gpg] https://apt.grafana.com stable main" | sudo tee /etc/apt/sources.list.d/grafana.list

sudo apt-get update

sudo apt-get install grafana-agent-flow
```

Then configure it following the instructions from [here](https://grafana.com/docs/agent/latest/flow/reference/components/loki.source.journal/). And finally just start it:

```bash
sudo systemctl enable grafana-agent-flow.service
sudo systemctl start grafana-agent-flow
```

Confirm it's running:

```bash
root@pm:~# systemctl status grafana-agent-flow

```

Using this filter `{component="loki.source.journal"}`, you'll be able to see the logs collected from `journalctl`:

I think I covered all the cases I needed :)
