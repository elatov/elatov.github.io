I was seeing the following in the logs:

I found a Cisco Community [2009482](https://supportforums.cisco.com/docs/DOC-23667). The KB wasn't very helpful, here is some content from the KB:

> **Cause**
> This message is logged, usually for write operations, when an ESX/ESXi host needs to stop I/O going to a device/LUN. A Virtual Device Reset is used to stop the I/O in order to maintain VMFS data integrity.
> **Resolution**
> To resolve this issue, you must investigate the reason why the ESX host issued the Virtual Device Reset. Typically there will be SCSI or other storage related errors before the virt-reset error message which should indicate the reason why the host needed to stop the I/O.

From the above logs, we can see that we had IO failing to the array. Here is the information regarding our CNA:

    ~ # cat /proc/scsi/qla2xxx/1 | head -6
    QLogic PCI Express to FCoE Converged Network Adapter for QMI8142:
    FC Firmware version 5.03.05 (8d4), Chip Type: QMI814x
    MPI Firmware Version: 1.40.00 (66561)
    Driver version 934.5.4.0-1vmw

    Host Device Name vmhba0


I did a couple of searches and I came across VMware KB [article](https://knowledge.broadcom.com/external/article?legacyId=2014323). All of them were regarding the QLE81xx or QMI81xx CNAs having issues with ESXi. All of the above KBs recommended to disable MSI-X Interrupts. This can be done by running the following on the host:

    ### For ESXi 5.x
    ~ # esxcli system module parameters set -m qla2xxx --parameter-string "ql2xenablemsi24xx=0"
    ### For ESXi 4.x
    ~ # esxcfg-module -s "ql2xenablemsi=1" qla2xxx


We were on 5.0, so we ran the top command. After running the above command the messages were not as frequent but still happening. Lastly I ran into VMware KB [link](https://knowledge.broadcom.com/external/article?legacyId=2008044) to the release notes). After applying that firmware version, the messages stopped.
