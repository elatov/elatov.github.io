The easiest way to do a network install with any Linux Distribution is to use **Kickstart**. From the "[Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6 Installation Guide](https://access.redhat.com/knowledge/docs/en-US/Red_Hat_Enterprise_Linux/6/pdf/Installation_Guide/Red_Hat_Enterprise_Linux-6-Installation_Guide-en-US.pdf)":

### RHEL Kickstart

> **Chapter 32. Kickstart Installations**
> **32.1. What are Kickstart Installations?**
>
> Many system administrators would prefer to use an automated installation method to install Red Hat Enterprise Linux on their machines. To answer this need, Red Hat created the **kickstart** installation method. Using **kickstart**, a system administrator can create a single file containing the answers to all the questions that would normally be asked during a typical installation. **Kickstart** files can be kept on a single server system and read by individual computers during the installation. This installation method can support the use of a single **kickstart** file to install Red Hat Enterprise Linux on multiple machines, making it ideal for network and system administrators. **Kickstart** provides a way for users to automate a Red Hat Enterprise Linux installation. All **kickstart** scriptlets and the log files of their execution are stored in the **/tmp** directory to assist with debugging installation failures.
>
> **32.2. How Do You Perform a Kickstart Installation?**
>
> **Kickstart** installations can be performed using a local **DVD**, a **local hard drive**, or via **NFS**, **FTP**, **HTTP**, or **HTTPS**. To use **kickstart**, you must:
>
> 1.  Create a **kickstart** file.
> 2.  Create a boot media with the **kickstart** file or make the **kickstart** file available on the network.
> 3.  Make the installation tree available.
> 4.  Start the **kickstart** installation.

### KickStart File

> **32.3. Creating the Kickstart File**
>
> The **kickstart** file is a simple text file, containing a list of items, each identified by a keyword. You can create it by using the **Kickstart Configurator** application, or writing it from scratch. The Red Hat Enterprise Linux installation program also creates a sample kickstart file based on the options that you selected during installation. It is written to the file **/root/anaconda-ks.cfg**. You should be able to edit it with any text editor or word processor that can save files as ASCII text.

Here is how mine looked like:

    [root@rhel1 ~]# cat anaconda-ks.cfg
    # Kickstart file automatically generated by anaconda.

    #version=DEVEL
    install
    cdrom
    lang en_US.UTF-8
    keyboard us
    network --onboot no --device eth0 --noipv4 --noipv6
    rootpw  --iscrypted $6$zV1LP62.FgeNH0/I$1ofQRdVBXeQxllfRjHfKWS9cUNo0
    firewall --service=ssh
    authconfig --enableshadow --passalgo=sha512
    selinux --enforcing
    timezone --utc America/Denver
    bootloader --location=mbr --driveorder=sda --append="nomodeset crashkernel=auto rhgb quiet"
    # The following is the partition information you requested
    # Note that any partitions you deleted are not expressed
    # here so unless you clear all partitions first, this is
    # not guaranteed to work
    #clearpart --all --drives=sda
    #volgroup VolGroup --pesize=4096 pv.008002
    #logvol / --fstype=ext4 --name=lv_root --vgname=VolGroup --grow --size=1024 --maxsize=51200
    #logvol swap --name=lv_swap --vgname=VolGroup --grow --size=512 --maxsize=1024

    #part /boot --fstype=ext4 --size=500
    #part pv.008002 --grow --size=1

    repo --name="Red Hat Enterprise Linux"  --baseurl=cdrom:sr0 --cost=100

    %packages --nobase
    @core
    %end


### KickStart Options

Now let's see what all the options means, from the above guide:

> **32.4. Kickstart Options**
>
> The following options can be placed in a **kickstart**
>
> **auth or authconfig (required)**
>
> Sets up the authentication options for the system. It is similar to the **authconfig** command, which can be run after the install. By default, passwords are normally encrypted and are not shadowed.
>
> *   **-enablenis** — Turns on NIS support. By default, -**-enablenis** uses whatever domain it finds on the network. A domain should almost always be set by hand with the **-nisdomain= option**.
> *   **-nisdomain=** — NIS domain name to use for NIS services.
> *   -**-nisserver=** — Server to use for NIS services (broadcasts by default).
> *   **-useshadow** or **-enableshadow** — Use shadow passwords.
> *   **-enableldap** — Turns on LDAP support in **/etc/nsswitch.conf**, allowing your system to retrieve information about users (for example, their UIDs, home directories, and shells) from an **LDAP** directory. To use this option, you must install the **nss-pam-ldapd** package. You must also specify a server and a base DN (distinguished name) with -**-ldapserver=** and **-ldapbasedn=**.
> *   **-enableldapauth** — Use LDAP as an authentication method. This enables the **pam_ldap** module for authentication and changing passwords, using an **LDAP** directory. To use this option, you must have the **nss-pam-ldapd** package installed. You must also specify a server and a base DN with -**ldapserver=** and -**-ldapbasedn=**. If your environment does not use **TLS** (Transport Layer Security), use the **-disableldaptls** switch to ensure that the resulting configuration file works.
> *   **-ldapserver=** — If you specified either **-enableldap** or **-enableldapauth**, use this option to specify the name of the **LDAP** server to use. This option is set in the **/etc/ldap.conf** file.
> *   **-ldapbasedn=** — If you specified either **-enableldap** or **-enableldapauth**, use this option to specify the DN in your **LDAP** directory tree under which user information is stored. This option is set in the **/etc/ldap.conf** file.
> *   **-enableldaptls** — Use **TLS** (Transport Layer Security) lookups. This option allows **LDAP** to send encrypted usernames and passwords to an **LDAP** server before authentication.
> *   **-disableldaptls** — Do not use *TLS* (Transport Layer Security) lookups in an environment that uses *LDAP* for authentication.
> *   **-enablekrb5** — Use *Kerberos* 5 for authenticating users. *Kerberos* itself does not know about home directories, *UIDs*, or shells. If you enable *Kerberos*, you must make users' accounts known to this workstation by enabling *LDAP*, *NIS*, or *Hesiod* or by using the **/usr/sbin/useradd** command. If you use this option, you must have the **pam_krb5** package installed.
> *   **-krb5realm=** — The *Kerberos* 5 realm to which your workstation belongs.
> *   **-krb5kdc=** — The *KDC* (or KDCs) that serve requests for the realm. If you have multiple *KDCs* in your realm, separate their names with commas (,).
> *   **-krb5adminserver=** — The *KDC* in your realm that is also running **kadmind**. This server handles password changing and other administrative requests. This server must be run on the master *KDC* if you have more than one *KDC*.
> *   **-enablehesiod** — Enable *Hesiod* support for looking up user home directories, *UIDs*, and shells. More information on setting up and using Hesiod on your network is in **/usr/share/doc/glibc-2.x.x/README.hesiod**, which is included in the **glibc** package. *Hesiod* is an extension of DNS that uses *DNS* records to store information about users, groups, and various other items.
> *   **-hesiodlhs** and **-hesiodrhs** — The *Hesiod LHS* (left-hand side) and *RHS* (right-hand side) values, set in **/etc/hesiod.conf**. The *Hesiod* library uses these values to search *DNS* for a name, similar to the way that *LDAP* uses a base DN.
>     To look up user information for the username jim, the Hesiod library looks up **jim.passwd**, which should resolve to a TXT record that contains a string identical to an entry for that user in the passwd file: **jim:*:501:501:Jungle Jim:/home/jim:/bin/bash**. To look up groups, the Hesiod library looks up **jim.group** instead.
>     To look up users and groups by number, make **501.uid** a **CNAME** for **jim.passwd**, and **501.gid** a **CNAME** for **jim.group**. Note that the library does not place a period (.) in front of the LHS and RHS values when performing a search. Therefore, if the *LHS* and *RHS* values need to have a period placed in front of them, you must include the period in the values you set for **-hesiodlhs** and **-hesiodrhs**.
> *   **-enablesmbauth** — Enables authentication of users against an *SMB* server (typically a Samba or Windows server). *SMB* authentication support does not know about home directories, *UIDs*, or shells. If you enable *SMB*, you must make users' accounts known to the workstation by enabling *LDAP*, *NIS*, or *Hesiod* or by using the **/usr/sbin/useradd** command.
> *   **-smbservers=** — The name of the servers to use for *SMB* authentication. To specify more than one server, separate the names with commas (,).
> *   **-smbworkgroup=** — The name of the workgroup for the *SMB* servers.
> *   **-enablecache** — Enables the **nscd** service. The **nscd** service caches information about users, groups, and various other types of information. Caching is especially helpful if you choose to distribute information about users and groups over your network using *NIS*, *LDAP*, or *Hesiod*.
> *   **-passalgo** — To set up the SHA-256 hashing algorithm, run the command **authconfig -passalgo=sha256 -kickstart**.To set up the SHA-512 hashing algorithm, run **authconfig -passalgo=sha512 -kickstart**.Remove the **-enablemd5** option if it is present.
>
> **autopart (optional)**
>
> Automatically create partitions — 1 GB or more root (/) partition, a swap partition, and an appropriate boot partition for the architecture. One or more of the default partition sizes can be redefined with the part directive.
>
> *   **-encrypted** — Should all devices with support be encrypted by default? This is equivalent to checking the Encrypt checkbox on the initial partitioning screen.
> *   **-passphrase=** — Provide a default system-wide passphrase for all encrypted devices.
> *   **-escrowcert=URL_of_X.509_certificate** — Store data encryption keys of all encrypted volumes as files in **/root**, encrypted using the X.509 certificate from the URL specified with **URL_of_X.509_certificate**. The keys are stored as a separate file for each encrypted volume. This option is only meaningful if **-encrypted** is specified.
> *   **-backuppassphrase=** — Add a randomly-generated passphrase to each encrypted volume. Store these passphrases in separate files in **/root**, encrypted using the X.509 certificate specified with **-escrowcert**. This option is only meaningful if**-escrowcert**is specified.
>
> **autostep (optional)**
>
> Similar to interactive except it goes to the next screen for you. It is used mostly for debugging.
>
> *   **-autoscreenshot** — Take a screenshot at every step during installation and copy the images over to **/root/anaconda-screenshots** after installation is complete. This is most useful for documentation.
>
> **bootloader (required)**
>
> Specifies how the boot loader should be installed. This option is required for both installations and upgrades.
>
> *   **-append=** — Specifies kernel parameters. To specify multiple parameters, separate them with spaces. For example:
>
>          bootloader --location=mbr --append="hdd=ide-scsi ide=nodma"
>
>
> *   **-driveorder** — Specify which drive is first in the BIOS boot order. For example:
>
>          bootloader --driveorder=sda,hda
>
>
> *   **-location=** — Specifies where the boot record is written. Valid values are the following:
>
>     *   **mbr** (the default), **partition** (installs the boot loader on the first sector of the partition containing the kernel), or **none** (do not install the boot loader).
>     *   **-password=** — If using GRUB, sets the GRUB boot loader password to the one specified with this option. This should be used to restrict access to the GRUB shell, where arbitrary kernel options can be passed.
>     *   **-md5pass=** — If using GRUB, similar to **-password=** except the password should already be encrypted.
>     *   **-upgrade** — Upgrade the existing boot loader configuration, preserving the old entries. This option is only available for upgrades.
>
> **clearpart (optional)**
>
> Removes partitions from the system, prior to creation of new partitions. By default, no partitions are removed.
>
> *   **-all** — Erases all partitions from the system.
> *   **-drives=** — Specifies which drives to clear partitions from. For example, the following clears all the partitions on the first two drives on the primary *IDE* controller:
>
>          clearpart --drives=hda,hdb --all
>
>
>     To clear a multipath device that does not use logical volume management (LVM), use the format **disk/by-id/dm-uuid-mpath-WWID**, where **WWID** is the world-wide identifier for the device. For example, to clear a disk with WWID **2416CD96995134CA5D787F00A5AA11017**, use:
>
>          clearpart --drives=disk/by-id/dm-uuid-mpath-2416CD96995134CA5D787F00A5AA11017
>
>
> *   **-initlabel** — Initializes the disk label to the default for your architecture (for example **msdos** for x86). It is useful so that the installation program does not ask if it should initialize the disk label if installing to a brand new hard drive.
>
> *   **-linux** — Erases all Linux partitions.
>
> *   **-none** (default) — Do not remove any partitions.
>
> **cmdline (optional)**
>
> Perform the installation in a completely non-interactive command line mode. Any prompts for interaction halts the install. This mode is useful on IBM System z systems with the 3270 terminal under z/VM and operating system messages applet on LPAR. The recommended use is in conjunction with **RUNKS=1** and **ks=**.
>
> **device (optional)**
>
> On most *PCI* systems, the installation program autoprobes for *Ethernet* and *SCSI* cards properly. On older systems and some *PCI* systems, however, **kickstart** needs a hint to find the proper devices. The device command, which tells the installation program to install extra modules, is in this format:
>
>     device moduleName --opts=options
>
>
> *   **moduleName** — Replace with the name of the kernel module which should be installed.
> *   **-opts=** — Options to pass to the kernel module. For example:
>     `--opts="aic152x=0x340 io=11"`
>
> **driverdisk (optional)**
>
> Driver diskettes can be used during **kickstart** installations. You must copy the driver diskettes's contents to the root directory of a partition on the system's hard drive. Then you must use the **driverdisk** command to tell the installation program where to look for the driver disk.
>
>     driverdisk partition --source=url --biospart=biospart [--type=fstype]
>
>
> Alternatively, a network location can be specified for the driver diskette:
>
>     driverdisk --source=ftp://path/to/dd.img
>     driverdisk --source=http://path/to/dd.img
>     driverdisk --source=nfs:host:/path/to/img
>
>
> *   **partition** — Partition containing the driver disk.
> *   **url** — URL for the driver disk. *NFS* locations can be given in the form **nfs:host:/path/to/img**.
> *   **biospart** — BIOS partition containing the driver disk (for example, **82p2**).
> *   **-type=** — File system type (for example, **vfat** or **ext2**).
>
> **firewall (optional)**
>
> This option corresponds to the Firewall Configuration screen in the installation program:
>
>     firewall --enabled|--disabled [--trust=] device incoming [--port=]
>
>
> *   **-enabled** or **-enable** — Reject incoming connections that are not in response to outbound requests, such as DNS replies or DHCP requests. If access to services running on this machine is needed, you can choose to allow specific services through the firewall.
> *   **-disabled** or **-disable** — Do not configure any iptables rules.
> *   **-trust=** — Listing a device here, such as **eth0**, allows all traffic coming from that device to go through the firewall. To list more than one device, use **-trust eth0 -trust eth1**. Do NOT use a comma-separated format such as **-trust eth0, eth1**.
> *   **incoming** — Replace with one or more of the following to allow the specified services through the firewall.
>
>     *   **-ssh**
>     *   **-telnet**
>     *   **-smtp**
>     *   **-http**
>     *   **-https**
>     *   **-ftp**
>
> *   **-port=** — You can specify that ports be allowed through the firewall using the port:protocol format. For example, to allow *IMAP* access through your firewall, specify **imap:tcp**. Numeric ports can also be specified explicitly; for example, to allow *UDP* packets on port 1234 through, specify **1234:udp**. To specify multiple ports, separate them by commas.
>
> **firstboot (optional)**
>
> Determine whether the firstboot starts the first time the system is booted. If enabled, the firstboot package must be installed. If not specified, this option is disabled by default.
>
> *   **-enable** or **-enabled** — The Setup Agent is started the first time the system boots.
> *   **-disable** or **-disabled** — The Setup Agent is not started the first time the system boots.
> *   **-reconfig** — Enable the Setup Agent to start at boot time in reconfiguration mode. This mode enables the language, mouse, keyboard, root password, security level, and time zone configuration options in addition to the default ones.
>
> **graphical (optional)**
>
> Perform the *kickstart* installation in graphical mode. This is the default.
>
> **halt (optional)**
>
> Halt the system after the installation has successfully completed. This is similar to a manual installation, where *anaconda* displays a message and waits for the user to press a key before rebooting. During a *kickstart* installation, if no completion method is specified, this option is used as the default.
>
> The **halt** option is equivalent to the **shutdown -h** command.
>
> For other completion methods, refer to the **poweroff**, **reboot**, and **shutdown** *kickstart* options.
>
> **ignoredisk (optional)**
>
> Causes the installer to ignore the specified disks. This is useful if you use autopartition and want to be sure that some disks are ignored. For example, without **ignoredisk**, attempting to deploy on a SAN-cluster the kickstart would fail, as the installer detects passive paths to the SAN that return no partition table. The syntax is:
>
>     ignoredisk --drives=drive1,drive2,...
>
>
> where **driveN** is one of **sda**, **sdb**,..., **hda**,... etc. To ignore a multipath device that does not use logical volume management (**LVM**), use the format **disk/by-id/dm-uuid-mpath-WWID**, where **WWID** is the world-wide identifier for the device. For example, to ignore a disk with **WWID** 2416CD96995134CA5D787F00A5AA11017, use:
>
>     ignoredisk --drives=disk/by-id/dm-uuid-mpath-2416CD96995134CA5D787F00A5AA11017
>
>
> Multipath devices that use **LVM** are not assembled until after *anaconda* has parsed the *kickstart* file. Therefore, you cannot specify these devices in the format *dm-uuid-mpath*. Instead, to ignore a *multipath* device that uses **LVM**, use the format **disk/by-id/scsi-WWID**, where **WWID** is the world-wide identifier for the device. For example, to ignore a disk with WWID **58095BEC5510947BE8C0360F604351918**, use:
>
>     igoredisk --drives=disk/by-id/scsi-58095BEC5510947BE8C0360F604351918
>
>
> *   **-only-use** — specifies a list of disks for the installer to use. All other disks are ignored. For example, to use disk **sda** during installation and ignore all other disks:
>     `ignoredisk --only-use=sda`
>     To include a *multipath* device that does not use *LVM*:
>     `ignoredisk --only-use=disk/by-id/dm-uuid-mpath-2416CD96995134CA5D787F00A5AA11017`
>     To include a multipath device that uses LVM:
>     `ignoredisk --only-use=disk/by-id/scsi-58095BEC5510947BE8C0360F604351918`
>
> **install (optional)**
>
> Tells the system to install a fresh system rather than upgrade an existing system. This is the default mode. For installation, you must specify the type of installation from **cdrom**, **harddrive**, **nfs**, or **url** (for *FTP*, *HTTP*, or *HTTPS* installations). The **install** command and the installation method command must be on separate lines.
>
> *   **cdrom** — Install from the first optical drive on the system.
> *   **harddrive** — Install from a Red Hat installation tree on a local drive, which must be either **vfat** or **ext2**.
>
>     *   **-biospart=** BIOS partition to install from (such as 82).
>     *   **-partition=** Partition to install from (such as **sdb2**).
>     *   **-dir=** Directory containing the **variant** directory of the installation tree.
>
>     For example:
>
>         harddrive --partition=hdb2 --dir=/tmp/install-tree
>
>
> *   **nfs** — Install from the *NFS* server specified.
>
>     *   **-server=** Server from which to install (hostname or IP).
>     *   **-dir=** Directory containing the **variant** directory of the installation tree.
>     *   **-opts=** Mount options to use for mounting the NFS export. (optional)
>
>     For example:
>
>         nfs --server=nfsserver.example.com --dir=/tmp/install-tree
>
>
> *   **url** — Install from an installation tree on a remote server via *FTP*, *HTTP*, or *HTTPS*. For example:
>
>          url --url http://server/dir
>
>
>     or:
>
>          url --url ftp://username:password'@'server/dir
>
>
> **interactive (optional)**
>
> Perform an interactive installation, but use the information in the *kickstart* file to provide defaults. During the installation, **anaconda** still prompts you at every stage. Either accept the values from the kickstart file by clicking **Next** or change the values and click **Next** to continue. Refer also to the **autostep** command.
>
> **iscsi (optional)**
>
>     iscsi --ipaddr= [options]
>
>
> Specifies additional **iSCSI** storage to be attached during installation. If you use the **iscsi** parameter, you must also assign a name to the iSCSI node, using the **iscsiname** parameter earlier in the *kickstart* file.
> We recommend that wherever possible you configure iSCSI storage in the system BIOS or firmware (iBFT for Intel systems) rather than use the iscsi parameter. **Anaconda** automatically detects and uses disks configured in BIOS or firmware and no special configuration is necessary in the *kickstart* file.
> If you must use the **iscsi** parameter, ensure that networking is activated at the beginning of the installation, and that the **iscsi** parameter appears in the kickstart file before you refer to **iSCSI** disks with parameters such as **clearpart** or **ignoredisk**.
>
> *   **-port=** (mandatory) — the port number (typically, **-port=3260**)
> *   **-user=** — the username required to authenticate with the target
> *   **-password=** — the password that corresponds with the username specified for the target
> *   **-reverse-user=** — the username required to authenticate with the initiator from a target that uses reverse **CHAP** authentication
> *   **-reverse-password=** — the password that corresponds with the username specified for the initiator**
>
> **iscsiname (optional)**
>
> Assigns a name to an iSCSI node specified by the **iscsi** parameter. If you use the **iscsi** parameter in your *kickstart* file, you must specify **iscsiname** earlier in the *kickstart* file.
>
> **keyboard (required)**
>
> Sets the default keyboard type for the system. The file **/usr/lib/python2.6/site-packages/system_config_keyboard/keyboard_models.py** on 32-bit systems or **/usr/lib64/python2.6/site-packages/system_config_keyboard/keyboard_models.py** on 64-bit systems contains list of keyboard type and is part of the **system-config-keyboard** package.
>
> **lang (required)**
>
> Sets the language to use during installation and the default language to use on the installed system. For example, to set the language to English, the kickstart file should contain the following line:
>
>     lang en_US
>
>
> The file **/usr/share/system-config-language/locale-list** provides a list of the valid language codes in the first column of each line and is part of the **system-config-language** package.
>
> Certain languages (for example, Chinese, Japanese, Korean, and Indic languages) are not supported during text-mode installation. If you specify one of these languages with the lang command, the installation process continues in English, but the installed system uses your selection as its default language.
>
> **logging (optional)**
>
> This command controls the error logging of anaconda during installation. It has no effect on the installed system.
>
> *   **-host=** — Send logging information to the given remote host, which must be running a **syslogd** process configured to accept remote logging.
> *   **-port=** — If the remote **syslogd** process uses a port other than the default, it may be specified with this option.
> *   **-level=** — One of **debug**, **info**, **warning**, **error**, or **critical**. Specify the minimum level of messages that appear on tty3. All messages will still be sent to the log file regardless of this level, however.
>
> **logvol (optional)**
>
> Create a logical volume for Logical Volume Management (**LVM**) with the syntax:
>
>     logvol mntpoint --vgname=name --size=size --name=name options
>
>
> The options are as follows:
>
> *   **-noformat** — Use an existing logical volume and do not format it.
> *   **-useexisting** — Use an existing logical volume and reformat it.
> *   **-fstype=** — Sets the file system type for the logical volume. Valid values are **xfs**, **ext2**, **ext3**, **ext4**, **swap**, **vfat**, and **hfs**.
> *   **-fsoptions=** — Specifies a free form string of options to be used when mounting the filesystem. This string will be copied into the **/etc/fstab** file of the installed system and should be enclosed in quotes.
> *   **-grow=** — Tells the logical volume to grow to fill available space (if any), or up to the maximum size setting.
> *   **-maxsize=** — The maximum size in megabytes when the logical volume is set to grow. Specify an integer value here such as 500 (do not include the unit).
> *   **-recommended=** — Determine the size of the logical volume automatically.
> *   **-percent=** — Specify the amount by which to grow the logical volume, as a percentage of the free space in the volume group after any statically-sized logical volumes are taken into account. This option must be used in conjunction with the **-size** and **-grow** options for logvol.
> *   **-encrypted** — Specifies that this logical volume should be encrypted, using the passphrase provided in the **-passphrase** option. If you do not specify a passphrase, anaconda uses the default, system-wide passphrase set with the autopart **-passphrase** command, or stops the installation and prompts you to provide a passphrase if no default is set.
> *   **-passphrase=** — Specifies the passphrase to use when encrypting this logical volume. You must use this option together with the **-encrypted** option; by itself it has no effect.
> *   **-escrowcert=URL_of_X.509_certificate** — Store data encryption keys of all encrypted volumes as files in /root, encrypted using the X.509 certificate from the URL specified with **URL_of_X.509_certificate**. The keys are stored as a separate file for each encrypted volume. This option is only meaningful if **-encrypted** is specified.
> *   **-backuppassphrase=** — Add a randomly-generated passphrase to each encrypted volume. Store these passphrases in separate files in /root, encrypted using the X.509 certificate specified with **-escrowcert**. This option is only meaningful if **-escrowcert** is specified.

>     monitor --monitor=monitorname|--hsync|vsync=frequency [--noprobe]
>
>
> *   **-hsync=** — Specifies the horizontal sync frequency of the monitor.
> *   **-monitor=** — Use specified monitor; monitor name should be from the list of monitors in **/usr/share/hwdata/MonitorsDB** from the **hwdata** package. The list of monitors can also be found on the X Configuration screen of the **Kickstart Configurator**. This is ignored if **-hsync** or **-vsync** is provided. If no monitor information is provided, the installation program tries to probe for it automatically.
> *   **-noprobe=** — Do not try to probe the monitor.
> *   **-vsync=** — Specifies the vertical sync frequency of the monitor.
>
> **network (optional)**
>
> Configures network information for the target system and activates network devices in the installer environment. The device specified in the first **network** command is activated automatically if network access is required during installation, for example, during a network installation or installation over VNC. From Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6.1 onwards, you can also explicitly require device to activate in the installer environment with the **-activate** option.
>
> *   **-activate** — activate this device in the installer environment. If you use the **-activate** option on a device that has already been activated (for example, an interface you configured with boot options so that the system could retrieve the kickstart file) the device is reactivated to use the details specified in the *kickstart* file. Use the **-nodefroute** option to prevent the device from using the default route. The **activate** option is new in Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6.1.
> *   **-bootproto=** — One of **dhcp**, **bootp**, **ibft**, or **static**. The **ibft** option is new in Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6.1. The **bootproto** option defaults to **dhcp**. **bootp** and **dhcp** are treated the same. The *DHCP* method uses a *DHCP* server system to obtain its networking configuration. As you might guess, the *BOOTP* method is similar, requiring a *BOOTP* server to supply the networking configuration. To direct a system to use *DHCP*:

>         network --bootproto=bootp
>
>
>     To direct a machine to use the configuration specified in *iBFT*, use:
>
>         network --bootproto=ibft
>
>
>     The static method requires that you specify the IP address, netmask, gateway, and nameserver in the kickstart file. As the name implies, this information is static and is used during and after the installation.All static networking configuration information must be specified on one line; you cannot wrap lines using a backslash as you can on a command line. A line that specifies static networking in a kickstart file is therefore more complex than lines that specify *DHCP*, *BOOTP*, or *iBFT*. Note that the examples on this page have line breaks in them for presentation reasons; they would not work in an actual kickstart file.

>     *   the MAC address of the interface, for example, **00:12:34:56:78:9a**
>     *   the keyword **link**, which specifies the first interface with its link in the **up** state
>     *   the keyword **bootif**, which uses the MAC address that **pxelinux** set in the **BOOTIF** variable. Set IPAPPEND 2 in your **pxelinux.cfg** file to have pxelinux set the **BOOTIF** variable.
>     *   the keyword **ibft**, which uses the MAC address of the interface specified by iBFT
>         `network --bootproto=dhcp --device=eth0`

> <!--t-->
>
> *   **-ip=** — IP address of the device.
> *   **-ipv6=** — IPv6 address of the device, or auto to use automatic neighbor discovery, or dhcp to use DHCPv6.
> *   **-gateway=** — Default gateway as a single IPv4 or IPv6 address.
> *   **-nameserver=** — Primary nameserver, as an IP address. Multiple nameservers must each be separated by a comma.
> *   **-nodefroute** — Prevents the interface being set as the default route. Use this option when you activate additional devices with the **-activate=** option, for example, a NIC on a separate subnet for an iSCSI target. The nodefroute option is new in Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6.1.
> *   **-nodns** — Do not configure any DNS server.
> *   **-netmask=** — Network mask of the device.
> *   **-hostname=** — Hostname for the installed system.
> *   **-ethtool=** — Specifies additional low-level settings for the network device which will be passed to the **ethtool** program.
> *   **-onboot=** — Whether or not to enable the device at boot time.
> *   **-dhcpclass=** — The DHCP class.
> *   **-mtu=** — The MTU of the device.
> *   **-noipv4** — Disable IPv4 on this device.
> *   **-noipv6** — Disable IPv6 on this device.

> **part or partition (required for installs, ignored for upgrades)**
>
> Creates a partition on the system.
> If more than one Red Hat Enterprise Linux installation exists on the system on different partitions, the installation program prompts the user and asks which installation to upgrade.
>
>     part|partition mntpoint --name=name --device=device --rule=rule [options]
>
>
> *   mntpoint — Where the partition is mounted. The value must be of one of the following forms:
>
>     *   **/path**
>         For example, **/**, **/usr**, **/home**
>     *   **swap** - The partition is used as swap space. To determine the size of the swap partition automatically, use the **-recommended** option:
>
>         `swap --recommended`
>
>         The size assigned will be equivalent to the swap space assigned by **-recommended** plus the amount of RAM on your system <!--t-->
>
>     *   **raid.id** - The partition is used for software RAID
>
>     *   **pv.id** - The partition is used for LVM.
>
> *   **-size=** - The minimum partition size in megabytes. Specify an integer value here such as 500 (do not include the unit).
>
> *   **-grow** - Tells the partition to grow to fill available space (if any), or up to the maximum size setting.
>
> *   **-maxsize=** - The maximum partition size in megabytes when the partition is set to grow. Specify an integer value here such as 500 (do not include the unit).
>
> *   **-noformat** — Specifies that the partition should not be formatted, for use with the **-onpart** command.
>
> *   **-onpart= or -usepart=** — Specifies the device on which to place the partition. For example:
>
>         partition /home --onpart=hda1
>
>
>     puts **/home** on **/dev/hda1**.
>     The device must already exist on the system; the **-onpart** option will not create it.
>
> *   **-ondisk= or -ondrive=** — Forces the partition to be created on a particular disk. For example, **-ondisk=sdb** puts the partition on the second SCSI disk on the system.
>     To specify a multipath device that does not use logical volume management (LVM), use the format **disk/by-id/dm-uuid-mpath-WWID**, where **WWID** is the *world-wide identifier* for the device. For example, to specify a disk with WWID **2416CD96995134CA5D787F00A5AA11017**, use:
>
>          part / --fstype=ext3 --grow --asprimary --size=100 --ondisk=disk/by-id/dm-uuid-mpath-2416CD96995134CA5D787F00A5AA11017
>
>
>     Multipath devices that use LVM are not assembled until after **anaconda** has parsed the kickstart file. Therefore, you cannot specify these devices in the format **dm-uuid-mpath**. Instead, to specify a multipath device that uses LVM, use the format **disk/by-id/scsi-WWID**, where **WWID** is the world-wide identifier for the device. For example, to specify a disk with WWID **58095BEC5510947BE8C0360F604351918**, use:
>
>         part / --fstype=ext3 --grow --asprimary --size=100 --ondisk=disk/by-id/scsi-58095BEC5510947BE8C0360F604351918

>
> *   **-type= (replaced by fstype)** — This option is no longer available. Use **fstype**.
>
> *   **-fsoptions** — Specifies a free form string of options to be used when mounting the filesystem. This string will be copied into the **/etc/fstab** file of the installed system and should be enclosed in quotes.
>
> *   **-fsprofile** — Specifies a usage type to be passed to the program that makes a filesystem on this partition. A usage type defines a variety of tuning parameters to be used when making a filesystem. For this option to work, the filesystem must support the concept of usage types and there must be a configuration file that lists valid types. For ext2, ext3, and ext4, this configuration file is **/etc/mke2fs.conf**.
>

> *   **-recommended** — Determine the size of the partition automatically.
>
> *   **-onbiosdisk** — Forces the partition to be created on a particular disk as discovered by the BIOS.
>
> *   **-encrypted** — Specifies that this partition should be encrypted, using the passphrase provided in the **-passphrase** option. If you do not specify a passphrase, **anaconda** uses the default, system-wide passphrase set with the **autopart** **-passphrase** command, or stops the installation and prompts you to provide a passphrase if no default is set.
>
> *   **-cipher**= — Specifies which type of encryption will be used if the **anaconda** default aes-xts-plain64 is not satisfactory. You must use this option together with the -encrypted option; by itself it has no effect. Available types of encryption are listed in the Red Hat Enterprise Linux Security Guide, but Red Hat strongly recommends using either aes-xts-plain64 or aes-cbc-essiv:sha256.

> **zerombr (optional)**
>
> If **zerombr** is specified any invalid partition tables found on disks are initialized. This destroys all of the contents of disks with invalid partition tables.
>
> Note that this command was previously specified as **zerombr yes**. This form is now deprecated; you should now simply specify **zerombr** in your kickstart file instead.

> **%include (optional)**
>
> Use the **%include** ***/path/to/file*** command to include the contents of another file in the kickstart file as though the contents were at the location of the **%include** command in the kickstart file.

### Kickstart Packages Selection

From the same guide:

> Use the **%packages** command to begin a kickstart file section that lists the packages you would like to install (this is for installations only, as package selection during upgrades is not supported).
>
> You can specify packages by group or by their package names. The installation program defines several groups that contain related packages. Refer to the **variant/repodata/comps-*.xml** file on the Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6 Installation DVD for a list of groups. Each group has an id, user visibility value, name, description, and package list. If the group is selected for installation, the packages marked **mandatory** in the package list are always installed, the packages marked **default** are installed if they are not specifically excluded elsewhere, and the packages marked **optional** must be specifically included elsewhere even when the group is selected.
>
> Specify groups, one entry to a line, starting with an @ symbol, a space, and then the full group name or group id as given in the **comps.xml** file. For example:
>
>     %packages
>     @ X Window System
>     @ Desktop
>     @ Sound and Video
>
>
> Note that the **Core** and **Base** groups are always selected by default, so it is not necessary to specify them in the **%packages** section.
>
> Specify individual packages by name, one entry to a line. You can use asterisks as wildcards to glob package names in entries. For example:
>
>     sqlite
>     curl
>     aspell
>     docbook*
>
>
> The **docbook***||||| entry includes the packages *docbook-dtds*, *docbook-simple*, *docbook-slides* and others that match the pattern represented with the wildcard.
>
> Use a leading dash to specify packages or groups to exclude from the installation. For example:
>
>     -@ Graphical Internet
>     -autofs
>     -ipa*fonts
>

### Kickstart Pre-Installation Script

> **32.6. Pre-installation Script**
>
> You can add commands to run on the system immediately after the **ks.cfg** has been parsed. This section must be placed towards the end of the kickstart file, after the kickstart commands described in “Kickstart Options” Section, and must start with the **%pre** command. If your kickstart file also includes a **%post** section, the order of the **%pre** and **%post** sections does not matter.
>
> You can access the network in the **%pre** section; however, name service has not been configured at this point, so only IP addresses work.
>
> **32.6.1. Example**
>
> Here is an example %pre section:
>
>     %pre
>     #!/bin/sh
>     hds=""
>     mymedia=""
>     for file in /proc/ide/h* do
>       mymedia=`cat $file/media`
>       if [ $mymedia == "disk" ] ; then
>           hds="$hds `basename $file`"

>     fi
>
>
> This script determines the number of hard drives in the system and writes a text file with a different partitioning scheme depending on whether it has one or two drives. Instead of having a set of partitioning commands in the kickstart file, include the line:
>
>     %include /tmp/part-include
>
>
> The partitioning commands selected in the script are used.

### Kickstart Post-Installation Scripts

> **32.7. Post-installation Script**
>
> You have the option of adding commands to run on the system once the installation is complete. This section must be placed towards the end of the kickstart file, after the kickstart commands described in the “Kickstart Options” Section, and must start with the **%post** command. If your kickstart file also includes a **%pre** section, the order of the **%pre** and **%post** sections does not matter.

>     umount /mnt/temp

> NFS file locking is not supported while in kickstart mode, therefore **-o nolock** is required when mounting an NFS mount.

### Making the Kickstart File Available

> **32.8. Making the Kickstart File Available**
>
> A kickstart file must be placed in one of the following locations:
>
> *   On removable media, such as a floppy disk, optical disk, or USB flash drive
> *   On a hard drive
> *   On a network
>
> Normally a kickstart file is copied to the removable media or hard drive, or made available on the network. The network-based approach is most commonly used, as most kickstart installations tend to be performed on networked computers.
>
> Let us take a more in-depth look at where the kickstart file may be placed.
>
> **32.8.2. Making the Kickstart File Available on the Network**
>
> Network installations using kickstart are quite common, because system administrators can quickly and easily automate the installation on many networked computers. In general, the approach most commonly used is for the administrator to have both a BOOTP/DHCP server and an NFS server on the local network. The BOOTP/DHCP server is used to give the client system its networking information, while the actual files used during the installation are served by the NFS server. Often, these two servers run on the same physical machine, but they are not required to.
>
> Include the **ks** kernel boot option in the **append** line of a target in your **pxelinux.cfg/default** file to specify the location of a kickstart file on your network. The syntax of the **ks** option in a **pxelinux.cfg/default** file is identical to its syntax when used at the boot prompt.
>
> If the **dhcpd.conf** file on the DHCP server is configured to point to **/var/lib/tftpboot/pxelinux.0** on the BOOTP server (whether on the same physical machine or not), systems configured to boot over the network can load the kickstart file and commence installation.
>
> **Example 32.2. Using the ks option in the pxelinux.cfg/default file**
>
> For example, if **foo.ks** is a kickstart file available on an NFS share at **192.168.0.200:/export/kickstart/**, part of your **pxelinux.cfg/default** file might include:
>
>     label 1
>       kernel RHEL6/vmlinuz
>       append initrd=RHEL6/initrd.img ramdisk_size=10000 ks=nfs:192.168.0.200:/export/kickstart/foo.ks
>

### Making the Installation Tree Available

More from the same guide:

> **32.9. Making the Installation Tree Available**
>
> The kickstart installation must access an installation tree. An installation tree is a copy of the binary Red Hat Enterprise Linux DVD with the same directory structure.
>
> If you are performing a DVD-based installation, insert the Red Hat Enterprise Linux installation DVD into the computer before starting the kickstart installation.
>
> If you are performing a hard drive installation, make sure the ISO images of the binary Red Hat Enterprise Linux DVD are on a hard drive in the computer.
>
> If you are performing a network-based (NFS, FTP or HTTP) installation, you must make the installation tree or ISO image available over the network.

### Starting a Kickstart Installation

Now for the final steps from the client side:

> **32.10. Starting a Kickstart Installation**
>
> To begin a kickstart installation, you must boot the system from boot media you have made or the Red Hat Enterprise Linux DVD, and enter a special boot command at the boot prompt. The installation program looks for a kickstart file if the **ks** command line argument is passed to the kernel. Here are the possible options for ks:
>
> **ks=nfs:server:/path**
>
> The installation program looks for the kickstart file on the NFS server ***server***, as file ***path***. The installation program uses DHCP to configure the Ethernet card. For example, if your NFS server is server.example.com and the kickstart file is in the NFS share **/mydir/ks.cfg**, the correct boot command would be `ks=nfs:server.example.com:/mydir/ks.cfg`.
>
> **ks={http|https}://server/path**
>
> The installation program looks for the kickstart file on the HTTP or HTTPS server ***server***, as file ***path***. The installation program uses DHCP to configure the Ethernet card. For example, if your HTTP server is server.example.com and the kickstart file is in the HTTP directory **/mydir/ks.cfg**, the correct boot command would be `ks=http://server.example.com/mydir/ks.cfg`.
>
> **ks=hd:device:/file**
>
> The installation program mounts the file system on ***device*** (which must be **vfat** or **ext2**), and looks for the kickstart configuration file as ***file*** in that file system (for example, `ks=hd:sda3:/mydir/ks.cfg`). <root> </root>

So let's try this out. Since we will setup other servers down the line, I decided to use an FTP server to serve/host the Installation Tree files. In this setup I will setup the RHEL6 Machine to remotely install RHEL5 on another VM.

### 1. Install and Setup FTP Server on RHEL 6

There are many different FTP servers but I decided to go with **vsftpd**.

    yum install -y vsftpd


Then edit the **/etc/vsftpd/vsftpd.conf** file and make it have the following modifications:

    [root@rhel1 ~]# grep -vE '^#|^$' /etc/vsftpd/vsftpd.conf
    anonymous_enable=YES
    anon_root=/var/www
    local_enable=YES
    write_enable=YES
    local_umask=022
    dirmessage_enable=YES
    xferlog_enable=YES
    connect_from_port_20=YES
    xferlog_std_format=YES
    listen=YES
    pam_service_name=vsftpd
    userlist_enable=YES
    userlist_deny=NO
    userlist_log=YES
    tcp_wrappers=YES


Then setup the 'anonymous' user to login:

    [root@rhel1 ~]# echo 'anonymous' >> /etc/vsftpd/user_list


### 2. Copy the Installation Tree to the Folder that FTP is Serving up

First mount the iso to the RHEL VM and then from the VM mount the cdrom:

    [root@rhel1]# mount /dev/cdrom /mnt
    mount: block device /dev/cdrom is write-protected, mounting read-only


Then copy all the files to the appropriate location:

    [root@rhel1 ~]# mkdir -p /var/www/pub
    [root@rhel1 ~]# rsync -avzP /mnt/. /var/www/pub/.


### 3. Create a Kickstart Script and Store it in our FTP Directory

If you want you can install the **system-config-kickstart** package and use the GUI to create the kickstart file. To install that just run the following:

    yum install system-config-kickstart


To start it just execute the following:

    system-config-kickstart


Since every anaconda install creates a kickstart file, I just copied that one:

    [root@rhel1 ~]# cp anaconda-ks.cfg ks.cfg


and edited to have the following contents:

    # Do an install not the upgrade
    install
    # Set the language
    lang en_US.UTF-8
    # Set the keyboard
    keyboard us
    # Skip RH Keyp
    key --skip
    # Use the text install
    text
    # Skip the display
    skipx
    # Specify where the install files are located
    url --url ftp://192.168.1.110/pub/
    # Assign a static IP & set the hostname
    network --device eth0 --hostname Rhel05_Machine --bootproto dhcp
    # Specify the root password by the Hash
    rootpw --iscrypted $1$HJOvNjRI$IB3pUvN
    # Enable the firewall and open up the SSH port
    firewall --enabled --port=22:tcp
    # Setup supported authentication methods
    authconfig --enableshadow --enablemd5
    # set the SElinux setting
    selinux --permissive
    # Set the timezone
    timezone --utc America/New_York
    # Set the bootload to be place in the MBR of the IDE Drive
    bootloader --location=mbr --driveorder=hda
    # Wipe all partitions
    clearpart --drives=hda --all --initlabel
    # Create a 100MB /boot partition
    part /boot --fstype ext3 --size=100
    # Create a 5GB / partition
    part / --fstype ext3 --size=5000
    # Create a 2GB swap
    part swap --size=2000
    # Use the rest of the free space on disk to create the /home partition
    part /home --fstype ext3 --size=100 --grow
    # Install the Base and Core packages, plus OpenSSH server & client packages
    %packages
    @Core
    @Base
    openssh-clients
    openssh-server


Now let's go ahead and add the file to our FTP server:

    [root@rhel1 ~]# mkdir /var/www/pub/ks
    [root@rhel1 ~]# cp ks.cfg /var/www/pub/ks/.


### 4. Start the FTP Server and Ensure it works

Let's enable service and start it:

    [root@rhel1 ~]# chkconfig vsftpd on
    [root@rhel1 ~]# service vsftpd start
    Starting vsftpd for vsftpd:  vsftpd


Then open up the firewall:

    [root@rhel1 ~]# iptables -I INPUT 5 -p tcp -m tcp --dport 20 -j ACCEPT
    [root@rhel1 ~]# iptables -I INPUT 5 -p tcp -m tcp --dport 21 -j ACCEPT
    [root@rhel1 ~]# service iptables save
    iptables: Saving firewall rules to /etc/sysconfig/iptables:


Since we are going to be using Passive mode we need to keep track of the connections. To do so, edit the **/etc/sysconfig/iptables-config** and modify the following line:

    [root@rhel1 ~]# grep trac /etc/sysconfig/iptables-config
    IPTABLES_MODULES="ip_conntrack_ftp"


Then let's restart the **iptables** service:

    [root@rhel1 ~]# service iptables restart
    iptables: Flushing firewall rules:
    iptables: Setting chains to policy ACCEPT: filter
    iptables: Unloading modules:
    iptables: Applying firewall rules:


Lastly if **selinux** is enabled allow ftp to connect to the directory structure by running the following:

    [root@rhel1 ~]# setsebool allow_ftpd_full_access=1


Then from another machine connect to the FTP server:

    [root@rhel2 ~]# lftp 192.168.1.110 -u anonymous
    Password:
    lftp anonymous@192.168.1.110:~> cd pub/ks
    cd ok, cwd=/pub/ks
    lftp anonymous@192.168.1.110:/pub/ks> ls
    -rw-r--r--    1 0        0            1622 Mar 13 14:27 ks.cfg
    lftp anonymous@192.168.1.110:/pub/ks> get ks.cfg
    1622 bytes transferred


*NOTE for the password, just leave it blank

That looks good.

### 5. Install and Configure a TFTP Server

FTP will allow us to download the packages during the install but during the boot up process we need something faster and we will use TFTP to boot from and to start the install. First let's install the server:

    [root@rhel1 ~]# yum install -y tftp-server


Now let's setup the TFTP tree structure:

    [root@rhel1 ~]# mkdir /tftpboot
    [root@rhel1 ~]# mkdir /tftpboot/images
    [root@rhel1 ~]# mkdir /tftpboot/pxelinux.cfg


Now let's copy over the Kernel files from the Installation Tree:

    [root@rhel1 ~]# cp /var/www/pub/images/pxeboot/vmlinuz /tftpboot/images/.
    [root@rhel1 ~]# cp /var/www/pub/images/pxeboot/initrd.img /tftpboot/images/.


Now let's install the **syslinux** package and copy the menu files over to the TFTP directory:

    [root@rhel1 ~]# yum install syslinux
    [root@rhel1 ~]# cp /usr/share/syslinux/menu.c32 /tftpboot/.
    [root@rhel1 ~]# cp /usr/share/syslinux/pxelinux.0 /tftpboot/.


Also, let's configure the Boot menu. Create the **/tftpboot/pxelinux.cfg/default** file and add the following to it:

    default menu.c32
    prompt 0
    timeout 10
    MENU TITLE PXE Menu
    LABEL RedHat 5
      MENU LABEL RedHat 5
      KERNEL images/vmlinuz
      append initrd=images/initrd.img linux ks=ftp://192.168.1.110/pub/ks/ks.cfg


Let's set up out TFTP server to serve up the **/tfptboot** directory. Edit the **/etc/xinetd.d/tftp** file and make the following modifications:

    [root@rhel1 ~]# grep -vE '^#|^$' /etc/xinetd.d/tftp
    service tftp
    {
        socket_type     = dgram
        protocol        = udp
        wait            = yes
        user            = root
        server          = /usr/sbin/in.tftpd
        server_args     = -s /tftpboot
        disable         = no
        per_source      = 11
        cps             = 100 2
        flags           = IPv4
    }


### 6. Start and Test out the TFTP Server

First let's enabled the **xinetd** service and start it up:

    [root@rhel1 ~]# chkconfig xinetd on
    [root@rhel1 ~]# service xinetd start
    Starting xinetd:  xinetd


Also let's make sure it's enabled:

    [root@rhel1 ~]# chkconfig --list | grep 'xinetd based services' -A 13
    xinetd based services:
        chargen-dgram:  off
        chargen-stream: off
        daytime-dgram:  off
        daytime-stream: off
        discard-dgram:  off
        discard-stream: off
        echo-dgram:     off
        echo-stream:    off
        rsync:          off
        tcpmux-server:  off
        tftp:           on
        time-dgram:     off
        time-stream:    off


Now let's open up the firewall and restart the firewall as well:

    [root@rhel1 ~]# iptables -I INPUT 5 -p udp -m udp --dport 69 -j ACCEPT
    [root@rhel1 ~]# service iptables save
    iptables: Saving firewall rules to /etc/sysconfig/iptables:
    [root@rhel1 ~]# service iptables restart
    iptables: Flushing firewall rules:
    iptables: Setting chains to policy ACCEPT: filter
    iptables: Unloading modules:
    iptables: Applying firewall rules:
    iptables: Loading additional modules: ip_conntrack_ftp


If **selinux** is enabled then reset the context on our folder:

    [root@rhel1 ~]# restorecon -v -R /tftpboot/


Now from another machine try to download a file:

    [root@rhel2 ~]# tftp 192.168.1.110
    tftp> verbose
    Verbose mode on.
    tftp> get pxelinux.0
    getting from 192.168.1.110:pxelinux.0 to pxelinux.0 [netascii]
    Received 27213 bytes in 1.2 seconds [181204 bit/s]


That looks good. </username>

### 7. Install and Configure a DHCP Server

First let's install the DHCP Server:

    [root@rhel1 ~]# yum -y install dhcp


Then copy a sample config file:

    [root@rhel1 ~]# cp /usr/share/doc/dhcp*/dhcpd.conf.sample /etc/dhcp/dhcpd.conf


and edit the **/etc/dhcp/dhcpd.conf** file to look like this:

    ddns-update-style none;
    authoritative;
    subnet 192.168.1.0 netmask 255.255.255.0 {
    ### Parameters for the local subnet ###
            option routers                  192.168.1.254;
            option subnet-mask              255.255.255.0;
            option domain-name              "example.com";
            option domain-name-servers      192.168.1.254;
            default-lease-time              21600;
            max-lease-time                  43200;
            range dynamic-bootp             192.168.1.100 192.168.1.200;
            #### PXE Server IP ###
            next-server                     192.168.1.110;
            filename                        "pxelinux.0";
    }


### 8. Start the DHCP Service and Obtain an IP Lease from it

First let's start it up:

    [root@rhel1 ~]# chkconfig dhcpd on
    [root@rhel1 ~]# service dhcpd start
    Starting dhcpd:  dhcpd


Lastly make sure it's running:

    [root@rhel1 log]# service dhcpd status
    dhcpd (pid  2964) is running...


Now let's open up the firewall:

    [root@rhel1 ~]# iptables -I INPUT 5 -p udp -m udp --dport 67 -j ACCEPT
    [root@rhel1 ~]# service iptables save
    iptables: Saving firewall rules to /etc/sysconfig/iptables:
    [root@rhel1 log]# service iptables restart
    iptables: Flushing firewall rules:
    iptables: Setting chains to policy ACCEPT: filter
    iptables: Unloading modules:
    iptables: Applying firewall rules:
    iptables: Loading additional modules: ip_conntrack_ftp


Now from a client let's try to obtain an IP address from our DHCP address:

    [root@rhel2 ~]# dhclient
    Internet Systems Consortium DHCP Client V3.0.5-RedHat
    Copyright 2004-2006 Internet Systems Consortium.
    All rights reserved.
    For info, please visit http://www.isc.org/downloads/dhcp/

    Listening on LPF/eth0/52:54:00:12:34:57
    Sending on   LPF/eth0/52:54:00:12:34:57
    Sending on   Socket/fallback
    DHCPDISCOVER on eth0 to 255.255.255.255 port 67 interval 8
    DHCPOFFER from 192.168.1.110
    DHCPREQUEST on eth0 to 255.255.255.255 port 67
    DHCPACK from 192.168.1.110
    bound to 192.168.1.111 -- renewal in 43135 seconds.


on our DHCP server we can see that our IP was leased:

    [root@rhel1 log]# tail -8 /var/lib/dhcpd/dhcpd.leases
    lease 192.168.1.111 {
      starts 3 2013/03/13 19:17:24;
      ends 4 2013/03/14 01:17:24;
      cltt 3 2013/03/13 19:17:24;
      binding state active;
      next binding state free;
      hardware ethernet 52:54:00:12:34:57;
    }


### 9. Reboot the Machine and Set it to Boot from the Network

You will see the machine contact the DHCP Server and then go to the TFTP Server:

[<img src="http://virtuallyhyper.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/tftp_boot_succesful.png" alt="tftp boot succesful RHCSA and RHCE Chapter 8 Network Installs" width="722" height="257" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-7625" title="RHCSA and RHCE Chapter 8 Network Installs" />](http://virtuallyhyper.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/tftp_boot_succesful.png)

If that is successful then you will see the PXE-Menu that you created, like so:

[<img src="http://virtuallyhyper.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/pxeboot_menu_g.png" alt="pxeboot menu g RHCSA and RHCE Chapter 8 Network Installs" width="714" height="399" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-7678" title="RHCSA and RHCE Chapter 8 Network Installs" />](http://virtuallyhyper.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/pxeboot_menu_g.png)

And then finally we will see the package starting to install:

[<img src="http://virtuallyhyper.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/package_installation_g.png" alt="package installation g RHCSA and RHCE Chapter 8 Network Installs" width="719" height="400" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-7679" title="RHCSA and RHCE Chapter 8 Network Installs" />](http://virtuallyhyper.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/package_installation_g.png)
