### Sophos
As I was going through the [lynis suggestions](/2017/06/install-lynis-and-fix-some-suggestions/), I realized that I should install an anti-virus solution on my machine. After reading a couple of sites:

* [AV-Test Lab tests 16 Linux antivirus products against Windows and Linux malware](http://www.networkworld.com/article/2989137/linux/av-test-lab-tests-16-linux-antivirus-products-against-windows-and-linux-malware.html)
* [The 7 Best Free Linux Anti-Virus Programs](https://www.makeuseof.com/tag/free-linux-antivirus-programs//)

I decided to try out [sophos](https://secure2.sophos.com/en-us/products/free-tools.aspx). I have used **clamav** in the past but apparently now it's detection rate is pretty low:

![av-det-rate](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/elatov/upload/master/sophos-install/av-det-rate.png)


### Installing Sophos

The instructions are covered in [Installing the standalone version of SAV for Linux/UNIX](https://community.sophos.com/kb/en-us/14378) and also in the [Sophos Anti-Virus for Linux startup guide](https://www.sophos.com/en-us/medialibrary/pdfs/documentation/savl_9_sgeng.pdf). I downloaded the archive (the [Sophos Anti-Virus for Linux/UNIX: Installing the standalone version](https://community.sophos.com/kb/en-us/14378) page has good screenshots of the process) and then I extracted the archive:

	<> tar xzf sav-linux-free-9.tgz

Now let's do the install:

	<> cd sophos-av
	<> sudo ./install.sh
	
	Sophos Anti-Virus
	=================
	Copyright (c) 1989-2016 Sophos Limited. All rights reserved.
	
	Welcome to the Sophos Anti-Virus installer. Sophos Anti-Virus contains an on-
	access scanner, an on-demand command-line scanner, the Sophos Anti-Virus daemon,
	and the Sophos Anti-Virus GUI.
	
	On-access scanner         Scans files as they are accessed, and grants access
	                          to only those that are threat-free.
	On-demand scanner         Scans the computer, or parts of the computer,
	                          immediately.
	Sophos Anti-Virus daemon  Background process that provides control, logging,
	                          and email alerting for Sophos Anti-Virus.

	Sophos recommends that you configure Sophos Anti-Virus to auto-update.
	
	It can update either from Sophos directly (requiring username/password details)

	username/password)).

	Installing Sophos Anti-Virus....
	Selecting appropriate kernel support...
	When Sophos Anti-Virus starts, it updates itself to try to find a Sophos kernel interface module update. This might cause a significant delay.
	Sophos Anti-Virus starts after installation.
	
	Installation completed.
	Your computer is now protected by Sophos Anti-Virus.

Also as an FYI, it looks likes the UI is no longer available for **sophos**.

#### Compiling the Talpa Module
Initially the **talpa** module failed to compile:

	[root@m2 kernels]# tail -11 /opt/sophos-av/log/talpaselect.log
	checking for linux/version.h... configure: error: cannot proceed without the required header file
	
	Traceback (most recent call last):
	  File "talpa_select.py", line 2176, in _action
	  File "talpa_select.py", line 1074, in load
	  File "talpa_select.py", line 841, in select
	  File "talpa_select.py", line 1696, in select
	  File "talpa_select.py", line 1780, in build
	  File "talpa_select.py", line 1910, in __try_build
	  File "talpa_select.py", line 1769, in checkConfigureErrors
	SelectException: exc-configure-failed-no-kernel-headers

I was missing the kernel source, so I installed that:

	<> sudo yum install kernel-devel

Re-running the compile worked out:

	[root@m2 ~]# /opt/sophos-av/engine/talpa_select select
	[Talpa-select]

And now let's load the module:

	[Talpa-select]
	Copyright (c) 1989-2016 Sophos Limited. All rights reserved.

	Loading Talpa kernel modules version 1.21.5...

And to confirm it's loaded:

	[root@m2 sophos-av]# lsmod | grep tal

	talpa_syscallhook      20252  1 talpa_vfshook

### Manually Updating Sophos
The update is configured to run every 60 minutes, but we can do one manually:

	[root@m2 etc]# /opt/sophos-av/bin/savupdate
	Updating from versions - SAV: 9.12.3, Engine: 3.65.2, Data: 5.30
	Updating Sophos Anti-Virus....
	Updating Talpa Binary Packs
	Updating SAVScan on-demand scanner
	Updating Virus Engine and Data
	Updating Talpa Kernel Support
	Updating Manifest
	Selecting appropriate kernel support...
	Update completed.
	Updated to versions - SAV: 9.12.3, Engine: 3.65.2, Data: 5.34
	Successfully updated Sophos Anti-Virus from sdds:SOPHOS

For good measure, let's restart the service after the update:

	<> sudo systemctl restart sav-protect.service

I also double checked the services were enabled:

	[root@m2 ~]# /opt/sophos-av/bin/savdstatus
	Sophos Anti-Virus is active and on-access scanning is running
	[root@m2 ~]# /opt/sophos-av/bin/savconfig query EnableOnStart
	true
	[root@m2 ~]# /opt/sophos-av/bin/savconfig query LiveProtection
	enabled

There are also a couple of services that are disabled (and I think that is okay):

	<> systemctl list-unit-files| grep sav
	sav-protect.service                           enabled
	sav-rms.service                               disabled
	sav-update.service                            disabled

### Configuring Sophos Settings
You can check out the basic settings by running the following:

	[root@m2 ~]# /opt/sophos-av/bin/savconfig query
	Email: root@localhost
	EmailDemandSummaryIfThreat: true
	EmailLanguage: English
	EmailNotifier: true
	EmailServer: localhost:25
	EnableOnStart: true
	ExclusionEncodings: UTF-8
	                    EUC-JP
	                    ISO-8859-1
	LogMaxSizeMB: 100
	NotifyOnUpdate: true
	PrimaryUpdateSourcePath: sophos:
	PrimaryUpdateUsername: ********
	PrimaryUpdatePassword: ********
	UploadSamples: false
	SendErrorEmail: true
	SendThreatEmail: true
	UINotifier: true
	UIpopupNotification: true
	UIttyNotification: true
	UpdatePeriodMinutes: 1440
	NamedScans: weekly
	LiveProtection: enabled
	ScanArchives: mixed

To get a full list you can run the following:

	[root@m2 ~]# /opt/sophos-av/bin/savconfig --advanced query

I enabled the option to be notified on an update:

	[root@m2 ~]# /opt/sophos-av/bin/savconfig set NotifyOnUpdate true
	[root@m2 ~]# /opt/sophos-av/bin/savconfig query NotifyOnUpdate
	true

By default the update period of 60 minutes so I decided to changed that to once a day:

	[root@m2 ~]# /opt/sophos-av/bin/savconfig set UpdatePeriodMinutes 1440

Else you will see this in the logs all the time (and if you enabled the option to be emailed on an update, you will get an email every 60 minutes):

	                                        Updating Manifest
	                                        Update completed.

	Dec 24 18:51:17 m2.kar.int systemd[1]: Starting "Sophos Anti-Virus update"...

### Running a quick scan manually
You can run a quick scan manually to see how clean your system is:

	> sudo /opt/sophos-av/bin/savscan /
	SAVScan virus detection utility

	End of Scan.

### Setup a schedule to scan weekly
Thi is covered in [Sophos Anti-Virus for Linux
configuration guide](https://www.sophos.com/en-us/medialibrary/PDFs/documentation/savl_9_cgeng.pdf) and [Sophos Anti-Virus v9.x For Unix/Linux: Scheduled scan options](https://community.sophos.com/kb/en-us/114372
). First create a folder for sheduled jobs:

	[root@m2 ~]# mkdir /opt/sophos-av/etc/jobs

Then copy the example to get started:

	<> sudo cp /opt/sophos-av/doc/namedscan.example.en /opt/sophos-av/etc/jobs/weekly

Modify the job to your needs:

	<> sudo vi /opt/sophos-av/etc/jobs/weekly

And lastly add it to the config:

	<> sudo /opt/sophos-av/bin/savconfig add NamedScans weekly /opt/sophos-av/etc/jobs/weekly

If you need to update it, first update the file (`vi /opt/sophos-av/etc/jobs/weekly`) and then update the config

	<> sudo /opt/sophos-av/bin/savconfig update NamedScans weekly /opt/sophos-av/etc/jobs/weekly

To always get a summary of the scheduled **savscan**, you can set the following option (as per the [Sophos Anti-Virus for Linux/Unix v9: Complete list of email alert settings](https://community.sophos.com/kb/en-us/118385):

	<> sudo /opt/sophos-av/bin/savconfig set EmailDemandSummaryAlways true

That should be it, enjoy **sophos**.
