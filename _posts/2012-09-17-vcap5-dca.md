## Study Guide for VCAP5-DCA

As with the VCAP-DCD, I found lot of good resources. I will add them as I go through Objectives. Here are some links for now:

*   [VCAP-DCA Index](http://www.seancrookston.com/vcap-dca/)
    *   Written by Sean Crookston, this is a study guide for VCAP4-DCA. Some of the objectives are similar to version 5 so they will be very helpful. Here is a [link](http://communities.vmware.com/docs/DOC-13726) to the PDF version.
*   [VCAP Datacenter Administration Exam Landing Page VDCA410](http://kendrickcoleman.com/index.php/Tech-Blog/vcap-datacenter-administration-exam-landing-page-vdca410.html)
    *   Written by Kendrick Coleman, very useful guide. Goes through all the objectives.
*   [VCAP-DCA4 Exam](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/elatov/upload/master/vcap-dca/VCAP-DCA_Study_Guide_v1_6.pdf)
    *   Study Guide Written by Damian Karlson
*   [VCAP4-DCA](http://www.vexperienced.co.uk/vcap-dca/)
    *   Study Guide Written by Edward Grigson, here is a [link](http://www.vexperienced.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2010/10/VCAP-study-guide-published-version.pdf) to the PDF version.
*   [VCAP5-DCA](https://storage.googleapis.com/grand-drive-196322.appspot.com/blog_pics/vcap5-dca/The-Unofficial-Official-VCAP5-DCA-Study-Guide.pdf)
    *   Written by Josh Coen, also covers version 5 and has a lot of great examples.
